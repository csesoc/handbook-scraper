        "overview": "Biotechnology can be defined as the use of various biological processes to make products and perform services. In biotechnology, living cells and biochemical macromolecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA are applied in a rapidly expanding range of activities of direct benefit to society. Biotechnology is used for the production of pharmaceuticals, food and industrial chemicals, in the development of improved crops and livestock for farming, for environmental clean-up, and in forensics. Modern biotechnology makes practical use of the most recent scientific advances in areas such as molecular genetics and molecular cell biology.\nThe development of recombinant DNA technology has resulted in the ability to create, modify and improve industrial organisms and to produce large quantities of any useful protein. Based on this technology, biopharmaceuticals including hormones, vaccines, anti-hypertensive agents, anti-inflammatory agents and new therapies for the treatment of cancer are being developed with the potential to revolutionise medicine. The sequencing of the human genome and the rapid emergence of high-throughput genomic and proteomic techniques is resulting in a surge of new drug targets. Translation of this advanced knowledge into useful therapies and improved medical practices requires the application of biotechnology.\nMicroorganisms and viruses are being modified for use in controlling plant and animal diseases and pests. Diagnostic kits are being developed for use in forensic science and in product identification and quality control. Genetic improvements in agriculture, plants and animals are becoming a reality, as is the control of inborn genetic disorders in humans. The ability to treat diseased and injured organs with replacement cells and tissues generated outside of the body is advancing rapidly.\nThe future for expansion in all the above areas is immense. Our ability to cope with many medical, environmental, agricultural and manufacturing problems in the 21st century will depend heavily on advances in biotechnology.",

        "overview": "The field of Materials Science and Engineering offers unlimited possibilities for innovation and development. Attention is being focused on developing and processing metals, ceramics, polymers and composites with improved properties.\nThe activities of the materials engineer range from materials production, including their extraction from ores and their refining, to the design, development, processing and recycling of materials for use in aerospace, transportation, electronics, energy conversion and biomedical systems.\nAdvanced materials can provide a major competitive advantage in virtually every part of a country&#39;s manufacturing industry. Because Australia is a country rich in minerals, materials science has been designated as a priority area for research and development. Examples of recent and significant developments include the emergence of environmentally friendly and economical metal processing methods, advanced surface coatings, biomedical materials, electrical ceramics, engineering polymers, and advanced composites.\nThe School of Materials Science and Engineering is in a good position to provide the increased numbers of graduates necessary for development of these new initiatives in materials. It is the only school in Australia that offers professional courses in ceramic engineering, metallurgical engineering and materials engineering as well as providing postgraduate specialisation in these fields.\nThe School is extremely well equipped with a wide range of advanced computing, thermal analysis, mechanical testing, X-ray and optical and electron microscopy facilities. Students are provided with education and industrial training to prepare them for a significant and important professional career.",

Students have a pathway to enhance their professional opportunities through developing cross-disciplinary skills and knowledge within a five year program. The School of Materials Science and Engineering administers the program, and the School of Chemical Engineering provides advice on the Chemical Engineering component of the program.\nThe broad objective of the Engineering (Honours) undergraduate programs is to develop well-educated graduates, that is, graduates with the strong technical knowledge and the basic skills and attributes required to practise as professional engineers. The desired skills are those that enable graduates to be independent investigators; self-motivated; critical thinkers; problem solvers; life-long learners; good communicators; team players; effective managers; as well as economically, environmentally and socially aware",

It is expected that those taking this program would progress to entrepreneurial and managerial roles.\nA full range of commerce and engineering careers is still open to those who qualify with both components of the dual degree. Most engineers progress to technical management roles, and these programs strengthen the commerce background in addition to providing the engineering skills.\nIncreasingly, engineers also find employment in the commercial sector, and the dual programs provide a good background for those entering banking, consultancy, etc. Students wishing to enter the purely commercial sector will benefit from technical and numerate strengths obtained as part of the Engineering program.",

        "overview": "Optometry combines the theoretical discipline of vision science with the clinical art of primary eye care. Vision science includes the optics of lenses and instruments, the physiology of the eye, the psychophysics of vision and the neuroscience of the brain.\nOptometry includes the diagnosis and management of ocular disease, the dispensing of spectacles and contact lenses, the management of people with special needs (children, low vision), sports vision and vision in the workplace. Graduates of this program will be able to register as an optometrist in Australia. The degree is also recognised in New Zealand and in most parts of Asia. Job opportunities in this field are excellent and are expected to remain excellent given the high visual demands in the modern computer-based workplace, and the ageing population in Australia.\nUpon completion of the Master of Clinical Optometry degree, students will be allowed to apply for registration with the Optometry Board leading to the practice of Optometry in Australia, New Zealand and most parts of Asia.\nGraduates of the dual award Bachelor of Vision Science/Master of Clinical Optometry will have specialised knowledge and skills for professional practice and research in Optometry and Vision Science and further learning.\nAccreditations\nThe program is accredited by the Optometry Council of Australia and New Zealand (OCANZ), the Optometry Board of Australia (OBA) and the Optometrists and Dispensing Opticians Board New Zealand (ODOB) for the purpose of registration in Australia and New Zealand.",

We consider the interior as a dynamic and open-ended conceptual space through which the human scale and experiences inherent in the private and public spaces of our urban environments can be interrogated and projected.\nThrough a focus on material and spatial assembly, agency and affect, we foster an agile and critical approach to design enquiry, underpinned by an informed appreciation of the environmental, cultural and historic contexts of interior architecture and design. We value an expansive approach in the speculation and projection of the contemporary interior, underpinned by rigour and creative risk taking.\nOur goal is to produce industry leaders with the ethical, collaborative and creative skills that will allow them to effectively respond to the multi-disciplinary, global demands inherent in the reshaping of our future interiorscapes.",

        "overview": "The Bachelor of City Planning (Hons) provides academic education and applied learning leading to professional, accredited qualifications in planning. The Program is of four years full-time duration with embedded Honours. The degree comprises core courses that develop and strengthen disciplinary foundations and help develop advanced and specific knowledge and skills; elective options including Built Environment Interdisciplinary Learning courses, an integrated learning Practice Year where students develop skills in the workplace as well as classroom; and a final year involving a Plan Making Studio, research thesis and opportunities to further pursue specialist areas of interest.\nPlanning is a varied and progressive profession which plays a pivotal role in decisions shaping the future of cities and regions. Planners need to see the whole picture: we need to be good thinkers, good analysts and good communicators. We work with stakeholders across the spectrum of interests - from global developers to local communities - to foster feasible, equitable, sustainable and progressive outcomes. Working at the interface between development and environment, the planner&#39;s role involves collecting and analysing information, identifying needs and options, making forecasts, preparing policies, plans and programs for implementation, exercising development control, investigating development proposals, and evaluating results, communicating outcomes and consultation. Sydney and NSW provide a fantastic laboratory to help understand the crucial role played by planners in addressing complex challenges, systematically placed in its global context through critical analysis and drawing upon best practice.\nThe Bachelor of City Planning (Hons) aims to produce high quality graduates who have acquired UNSW Graduate attributes and are capable, through their skills, knowledge and experience, of undertaking a wide range of tasks required of a qualified planning practitioner. As well as preparing for the profession, a planning degree provides lifelong analytical, collaborate and communication skills much in demand more widely.",

Students at UNSW learn the theory and practice of Landscape Architecture through the exploration of design principles, graphic techniques, ecological processes and studies of human modification of the environment. The emphasis of the program is on creative design inspired by the Australian situation, and prepares our students to work anywhere in the world.\nThe Bachelor of Landscape Architecture degree provides academic education and practical experience leading to professional qualifications in landscape architecture. It requires full time attendance for four years plus work experience that must be completed prior to graduation. For students unable to undertake full-time study, the Program Director may negotiate a part-time study schedule to enable students to complete the program over a longer period. The degree may be awarded with honours based upon the quality of overall performance and performance in the research and design project courses in the final year of study.\nThe program seeks the synthesis of knowledge and skills through project based learning in a sequence of eight Design Studios. Design projects are related to the subject matter of concurrent courses and culminate in an independent design study of regional and national significance. Lectures and practical semesters cover theoretical knowledge in the following areas:\nLandscape Architectural Design\nDesign Communications\nLandscape Architectural History and Theory\nLandscape Architectural Technology\nNatural and Cultural Systems\nProfessional Practice\nAt UNSW landscape architecture is taught as a powerful way of thinking and a vocation. Graduates of the UNSW landscape architecture program are creative problem solvers, able to draw on a depth and range of knowledge and skills. The vocational aspects of landscape architectural education at UNSW equip students with the theoretical and practical knowledge needed for the implementation of landscape design at site, urban and regional scales.",

        "overview": "Psychology is a discipline of both scientific research and applied practice. As a science, psychology is concerned with the study of behaviour and its underlying mental and neural processes. Students gain an integrated and comprehensive education in main discipline areas, including developmental, social, cognitive, biological, physiological and abnormal psychology. The program also develops research methods skills. Psychology has many areas of cutting edge interdisciplinary research and application and students have an option to pursue individual interests, choosing electives from a range of specialist areas, including psychology and law; psychology and work; development disorders; psychopathology; health psychology, language, cognitive science, neuroscience and others.\nPsychology has many areas of application, especially in clinical, correctional, counselling, educational, and organisational settings. In addition, people with training in psychology pursue careers in academic research, health research, developmental disabilities and rehabilitation, ergonomics, occupational health and safety, personnel selection, training, and management, vocational guidance, and marketing.\nThe program allows students to complete an APAC-accredited undergraduate sequence in psychology across three years. The program is designed to allow students to complete a complementary major (in a related discipline where there is a professional and/or academic rationale that supports the proposed combination). Complementary majors available outside of the Faculty of Science include behavioural economics, marketing, human resource management, criminology, linguistics and philosophy. From the Faculty of Science, students may choose a complementary major in neuroscience or vision science. Upon completion of this program students may choose to complete an additional fourth year program in psychology (Honours), subject to satisfying the entry requirements (refer to the Pathways section).\nThe basic rules for the degree are set out under the Program Structure section of this Handbook. Students must ensure that they complete a minimum of 78 units of credit (UoC) in Psychology, a combination of PSYCxxxx core and PSYC3xxx elective courses (as defined under Program Structure). The remaining UoC may comprise of courses offered by the Faculty of Science or any other Faculty. Please consult the School of Psychology for detailed definitions of complementary majors and their appropriate program structures (refer to the Sample Programs section).",
        "structure_summary": "Students must complete 144 UOC when taken as a standalone program.\n1. At least 78 UOC of Psychology courses 2. 54 UOC of Free Electives (see Complementary majors, below) 3. 12 UOC General Education courses\nStudents who do not choose to complete a complementary major complete 54 UOC of Free Electives in total.\nIf a student uses their Free Electives to complete a complementary major, the remaining Free Elective UOC to be completed will vary depending on the major chosen, as follows.\nMajors in:\n- Linguistics or Philosophy: 12 UOC of Free Electives. - Criminology, Behavioural Economics, Human Resource Management, Management or Marketing: 18 UOC of Free Electives. - Neuroscience: 0 UOC of Free Electives.\nGEN# coded courses can only be used to fulfil the General Education requirement of the program (i.e., they cannot be used to fulfil the Free Elective requirement). Any exceptions to these rules must be approved by the Associate Dean (Academic Programs) or nominee.",

        "overview": "Economics is an influential social science that explores human behaviour and decision-making, with a focus on the roles played by incentives, resource constraints, laws, customs, and institutions. When you study the Bachelor of Economics at UNSW, you ll explore how the decisions of institutions and individuals interact to determine outcomes for the economy and society.\nAs a graduate of economics, your distinct insights can be applied broadly. Through this degree, you&#39;ll gain highly transferable analytical skills that are valuable in a diverse range of careers.\nIn addition to more traditional economic issues like unemployment, taxation, and trade policy, economics allows you to understand and address human challenges like inequality, climate change, corruption, political polarisation, and impediments to education and health care.\nKey features\nLearn how to change the world\nYou ll explore and find solutions to the important issues of our time. Economics uncovers the forces behind global inequality and the drivers of international relations. It explores policymaking and regulation, inflation, property rights, labour markets, our interaction with the environment, firm organisation and competition, and strategic interaction.\nBecome highly sought after by industry and government\nUNSW Economics graduates are keenly sought after by policymakers at all levels of government, private sector employers, not-for-profits, and international organisations. They work in diverse careers as analysts, researchers, forecasters, journalists, and advisors.\nBuild your expertise\nOur flexible program allows you to shape your degree around your interests and goals. Choose from three specialisations in economics, build your own program, or complement your economics studies with other Business and Commerce courses. You can also study this program as a double degree to combine your expertise.\nPut theory into practice\nYou ll apply your academic learning through practical experience, empowering you to use economics and leadership to change the world. Opportunities for practical experience include internships, group consulting projects, and global practicums.",

As part of the degree program students will complete a major stream in both Information Systems (IS) and an approved disciplinary stream within the UNSW Business School.\nIn selecting their combination of majors, students should note that while there is a wide range of choice, not every combination may be able to be completed in 4 years of full-time study.",

The B Com component provides students with the fundamentals of business and the opportunity to explore their interests in one of a range of business disciplines.\nThe B Media component equips you with expertise to make a difference in the exciting, challenging, and constantly evolving field of media. Media at UNSW pushes you to develop confidence in a diverse and flexible mix of creative, critical, and practical knowledges. You will gain essential skills for navigating media in the 21st century so that you can collaborate effectively, and drive and respond to innovation.\nIt is assumed that students have a certain level of knowledge in advanced mathematics in order to cope well with the mathematical or statistical component of a business degree. If you are successful in obtaining a place without this assumed knowledge, you are strongly encouraged to consider studying a Mathematics Bridging Course before starting your degree.\nThis double degree provides graduates with great opportunities to work across a wide range of communication disciplines and fields.",

As a science, psychology is concerned with the study of behaviour and its underlying mental and neural processes. Topics of study include learning, memory, cognition, perception, motivation, life-span development, personality, social interactions, and abnormal psychology. The program also develops research methods skills. Psychology has many areas of cutting edge interdisciplinary research and application and students have an option to pursue individual interests, choosing electives from a range of specialist areas, including psychology and law; psychology and work; development disorders; psychopathology; health psychology, language, cognitive science, neuroscience and others.\nPsychology has many areas of application, especially in clinical, correctional, counselling, educational, and organisational settings. In addition, people with training in psychology pursue careers in academic research, health research, developmental disabilities and rehabilitation, ergonomics, occupational health and safety, personnel selection, training, and management, vocational guidance, and marketing.\nIn the fourth year of the program, students conduct a year-long, 30 UOC major independent research project (completed under the guidance of an academic supervisor), and write a thesis based on the project. In addition, students complete 18 UOC of advanced-level core and elective coursework in both Term 1 and Term 2.\nThe research project may be undertaken in most areas of psychology including: psychopathology; behavioural neuroscience; cognitive science; cognition and perception; forensic psychology; and social, personality and developmental psychology. The project culminates in a written thesis, which is assessed independently by two academics (neither of which is the student&#39;s supervisor).\nThe coursework requirement includes content that encompasses history, professional ethics, evidence-based practice and advanced coverage of selected contemporary issues in psychology that reflect the expertise and research specialisations of School staff.",

Civil Engineers essentially engineer and manage the infrastructure of our built environment including buildings, bridges, roads and highways, tunnels, airfields, dams, ports and harbours, railways, new mines, water supply and sewerage schemes, irrigation systems and flood mitigation works.\nThe Civil Engineering with Architecture program provides for an appreciation of architectural principles and an understanding of both the architect&#39;s role in construction and the interaction between architects and engineers. The ultimate aim is to help students become conceptual thinkers, inspired by beautiful creations to build even better ones, to develop an appreciation for beauty with the mathematical ability to challenge the traditional boundaries of structural design. Students graduating from this degree will be well qualified to collaborate with architects and other professionals in the built environment to produce integrated and sustainable design. Creativity and inventiveness are the key attributes of this program.\nIn the final year of the program students may elect to major in structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, transport engineering, water engineering or engineering construction and management.\nThis program can be taken on a four-year full-time basis or on a part-time basis subject to the approval of the Head of School. Intending part-time students are advised that all courses are offered only in the daytime.",

        "overview": "Actuarial Studies is concerned about more than just mathematics and numbers. It combines study in mathematics, economics, insurance, finance, statistics and programming. This double degree will allow interested students to complement their Actuarial Studies with business analytics.\nThe analytics skill set is one of the core sub-disciplines of the actuarial profession. The data analytics space is a rapidly evolving area with broad reaching applications. The advent of big data has led to an explosion in captured data, analytics approaches and businesses harnessing this data to create new industries or reinvent the way existing industries operate. Pursuing a joint program in Information Systems allows students to build up their business analytics skills. This will assist students to use modelling and data analysis techniques on large data sets to discover predictive patterns and relationships for business use. Solid skills in programming will also assist students during their actuarial career and actuarial employers report an unmet demand for candidates who have proficient business analytics skills.",

However, some first year Business courses required for both degrees overlap,\nand therefore the total minimum UOC required for the double degree is reduced by 24 UOC to 192 UOC.\n\nBachelor of Actuarial Studies (96 UOC)\n\n\nLevel 1 Core Courses* (48 UOC)\nLevel 2 Core Courses (24 UOC)\nLevel 3 Actuarial Studies Electives (24 UOC)\n\n\nBachelor of Information Systems (120 UOC)\n\n\nBusiness Core Courses (30 UOC) (Students are not required to complete COMM1100, COMM1110 and COMM1190 as the content is covered by the Economics and Mathematics courses taken in the first year of the Actuarial Studies program. Also COMM1140 and COMM1180 are completed as part of the Actuarial Studies program and also count towards meeting this rule*. Students therefore are not required to enrol in any additional Business Core Courses listed in the rule below to meet this requirement).\nInformation Systems Core Courses (72 UOC).\nInformation Systems Electives (12 UOC) - see note below.\nWork Integrated Learning (6 UOC)\n\n\nNOTE: special substitution arrangements exist depending on your choice of electives as follows:-\n\nIf you select INFS3603 Introduction to Business Analytics you do not have to take COMM2501 Data Visualisation and Communication in the Actuarial Studies program. INFS3603 will be counted towards the requirement for COMM2501.\nIf you wish to take INFS3873 Business Analytics Methods, completion of ACTL3142 Statistical Machine Learning for Risk and Actuarial Applications as an elective in the Actuarial studies program can be counted as a substitute for INFS3783 and will satisfy this as an elective in the Information Systems program.\n\n\n\nElectives\n\nDue to course sharing across the Actuarial Studies and Information Systems components, students will meet the disciplinary component requirements of the two awards in less than 192 UOC. Once the requirements for the Actuarial Studies and Information Systems programs have been met, students need to take free electives (including Business School electives) to ensure a total of 192 UOC is completed for the Double-Degree .",

As such, students cannot generally request a transfer into this exit degree.\nThe Bachelor of Engineering Science provides graduates with a grounding in a specific engineering discipline, as well as foundational knowledge in the underlying theories and sciences that provides the basis for engineering. It provides graduates with technical skills and confidence to analyse and apply their knowledge to solve engineering problems. Graduates will also be able to think in terms of systems and complex interactions and be capable of contributing effectively in teams.\nThe Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) is a highly valued business qualification offering students a career-focused education for long term success. Students are empowered to become adaptive thinkers and drive purposeful change to thrive in a fast-changing world.\nA unique feature of the BCom is the Integrated First Year, where students learn about business management and the broader environment in which an organisation operates, with a strong focus on developing professional skills and capabilities.\nIn this flexible, diverse and comprehensive business degree, students have exclusive access to Career Accelerator\nan impressive suite of career-boosting opportunities. Completion of at least one for-credit Career Accelerator course is a signature feature of the BCom.\nStudents complete up to two majors, selecting from a comprehensive and industry advised suite, including Accounting, Business Analytics, Economics, Finance, FinTech, HR, Information Systems, International Business, Marketing and Taxation, many fulfilling professional accreditation requirements.\nThe myBCom Series, designed in collaboration with industry and alumni, guides students to develop a personalised roadmap to get the full benefit of the curricular and co-curricular opportunities offered in the BCom. Students graduate with their personal digital myBCom Graduate Portfolio, showcasing their academic, technical and practical career-ready skills and capabilities for a fulfilling career.",

As such, students cannot generally request a transfer into this exit degree.\nThe Bachelor of Engineering Science provides graduates with a grounding in a specific engineering discipline, as well as foundational knowledge in the underlying theories and sciences that provides the basis for engineering. It provides graduates with technical skills and confidence to analyse and apply their knowledge to solve engineering problems. Graduates will also be able to think in terms of systems and complex interactions and be capable of contributing effectively in teams.\nThe Bachelor of Computer Science involves the study of the design, construction and uses of computer systems. It is concerned with the representation of data and data structures in computer systems and the design of algorithms for automatic manipulation of this information by programming languages and machine systems. It is very much concerned with the design and development of hardware and software tools by which computer applications may be developed, but not so much with the applications themselves. It is, however, noted that non-computing elements (such as human interface or psychological aspects) can often dictate the level of success of computing systems. At UNSW, particular emphasis is given to comprehension of the basic principles behind computing tools, operating systems, compilers and translators, and computer hardware.",

Students should seek advice from the Faculty of Science regarding their Advanced Science (Honours) program, and the relevant Engineering School Office, or the Faculty of Engineering, regarding their Engineering program.",

Students must also complete at least 60 days of approved Industrial Training experience.\nBachelor of Advanced Science (Honours) (144 UOC)\n\nAn approved Bachelor of Advanced Science (Honours) major; and\n48 units of credit Honours Year; and\nScience elective courses\n\nIn this dual degree students take 168 UOC for the Bachelor of Engineering (Hons), and 144 UOC for the Bachelor of Advanced Science (Hons), for a total of 312 UOC. Because the Science courses required for both degrees overlap, the total minimum UOC required for the dual degree is reduced by 24 UOC to 288 UOC. Depending on the chosen combination of Engineering stream and Advanced Science major there may be more than 24 UOC of overlapping courses. When a student meets all the requirements for both degrees in less than 288 UOC, students must complete additional elective courses to bring the total to 288 UOC. Those electives must be taken from the Faculty of Engineering and/or the Faculty of Science.\n\nIn some cases, course overlaps will require students to replace the usual course in one core or major with a more advanced course required in the other program. Specifically,\n\nStudents completing a Vision Science major count DESN1000 in place of SCIF1131\nStudents completing a Maths major should replace the upper level math course in Engineering as follows:\nCivil Engineering: CVEN2002 or CVEN2702 - replace with MATH2301 and MATH2801 or higher versions\nMechatronic Engineering: MATH2089 - replace with MATH2301 and MATH2801 or higher versions\nElectrical Engineering: MATH2069 - replace with MATH2011 and MATH2521 or higher versions, and MATH2099 -- replace with MATH2501 and MATH2801 or higher versions\nSoftware Engineering: MATH2859 + MATH2400 - replace with (MATH2801 or MATH2901) and MATH3411",

Because the Science courses required for both degrees overlap, the total minimum UOC required for the dual degree is reduced by 24 UOC to 240 UOC. Depending on the chosen combination of Engineering stream and Science major there may be more than 24 UOC of overlapping courses. When a student meets all the requirements for both degrees in less than 240 UOC, students must complete additional elective courses to bring the total to 240 UOC. Those electives must be taken from the Faculty of Engineering and/or the Faculty of Science.\n\nIn some cases, course overlaps will require students to replace the usual course in one core or major with a more advanced course required in the other program. Specifically,\n\nStudents completing a Vision Science major count DESN1000 in place of SCIF1131\nStudents completing a Maths major should replace the upper level math course in Engineering as follows:\nCivil Engineering: CVEN2002 or CVEN2702 - replace with MATH2301 and MATH2801 or higher versions\nMechatronic Engineering: MATH2089 - replace with MATH2301 and MATH2801 or higher versions\nElectrical Engineering: MATH2069 - replace with MATH2011 and MATH2521 or higher versions, and MATH2099 -- replace with MATH2501 and MATH2801 or higher versions\nSoftware Engineering: MATH2859 + MATH2400 - replace with (MATH2801 or MATH2901) and MATH3411",

The typical duration of this program is 5 years full-time.\nThe Advanced Mathematics (Honours) and Computer Science degrees lend themselves well to each other. While the Advanced Mathematics (Honours) degree focuses on an in-depth understanding of pure and applied mathematics, the computer science degree looks at the design, construction and uses of computer systems. Your mathematics study will assist with the manipulation of data as well as the development of algorithms in computer science. There is no better degree to combine your passion for mathematics as well as computer systems.",

The Science courses required for both degrees can overlap. Depending on the chosen combination of Computer Science major and Advanced Mathematics major there may be varying amounts of overlapping courses. When a student meets all the requirements for both degrees in less than 240 UOC, students must complete additional elective courses to bring the total to 240 UOC. Those electives must be taken from the Faculty of Engineering and/or the Faculty of Science.\n\nIn some cases, course overlaps will require students to replace the usual course in one core or major with a more advanced course required in the other program. Specifically:\n- Students must complete MATH1141 and MATH1241 or higher versions.",

The typical duration of this program is 5 years full-time.\nThe Bachelor of Advanced Science (Honours) is the degree of choice for innovative thinkers with exceptional scientific knowledge and skills. It&#39;s designed for talented students and offers the flexibility to tailor the degree in a way that works for them. The degree offers students access to advanced level courses and includes an Honours year.\nThe Bachelor of Science (Computer Science) focuses on the design and development of hardware and software tool by which computer applications may be developed. By combining your passion for science and the computer sciences you could further develop applications for use within the scientific world.",

The Science courses required for both degrees can overlap. Depending on the chosen combination of Computer Science major and Advanced Science (Honours) major there may be varying amounts of overlapping courses. When a student meets all the requirements for both degrees in less than 240 UOC, students must complete additional elective courses to bring the total to 240 UOC. Those electives must be taken from the Faculty of Engineering and/or the Faculty of Science.\nIn some cases, course overlaps will require students to replace the usual course in one core or major with a more advanced course required in the other program. Specifically:\n\n- Students must complete MATH1141 and MATH1241 or higher versions.",

Because of the overlap of 24 units of credit of Science courses in both core, the total units of credit required for completion is 240 UOC, rather than 264 UOC (please see Academic Rules below for more details).",

Because the courses required for both degrees overlap, the total minimum UOC required for the double degree is reduced by 24 UOC to 240 UOC.\nDepending on the chosen combination of Engineering stream and Computer Science major there may be more than 24 UOC of overlapping courses. When a student meets all the requirements for both degrees in less than 240 UOC, students must complete additional elective courses (on top of the required 12 UOC of free electives) to bring the total to 240 UOC. Students must take these additional electives from Faculty of Engineering and/or the School of Computer Science\nSome courses are double counted. Additionally the course overlaps require students to replace the usual course in one core or major with a more advanced course required in the other program. Specifically,\n\nStudents MUST take COMP1511 as their first year Engineering computing course, COMP1511 is then double counted towards both degrees\nCOMP1521 is a core requirement (BSc) and is double counted towards the BE(Hons) as a first year Engineering elective.

The two Maths course are double counted towards both degrees.\nCOMP4920 is required for the BSc, however students do not enrol in this course, and instead double count the management or ethics course in their chosen Engineering stream. Students take a free elective with the 6uoc freed up from not taking COMP4920\nMATH1081 is a core requirement (BSc) but is replaced by the 2nd year Maths course taken in the BE(Hons) major.

The Science courses required for both degrees can overlap. Depending on the chosen combination of Computer Science major and Science major, there may be varying amounts of overlapping courses. When a student meets all the requirements for both degrees in less than 192 UOC, students must complete additional elective courses to bring the total to 192 UOC.",

        "overview": "UNSW Medicine offers a six year integrated Medicine program (288 UOC) which leads to the awards of Bachelor of Medical Studies (BMed) and Doctor of Medicine (MD).\nThe program includes a compulsory Independent Learning Project (30 UOC) to ensure that all graduates acquire knowledge of research principles and methods applicable to Medicine and its professional practice.\nThe objectives of the Medicine program are:\nTo establish an integrated, interconnected and organised medical knowledge base as a platform for a professional and personal life of learning through experience.\nTo develop effective interactions with oneself through reflection; interaction with others through communication; and interaction with information and learning resources through information literacy and critical analysis.\nTo develop a set of personal attributes and skills appropriate to the professional practice of Medicine.\nThe program is organised into two degrees:\nBachelor of Medical Studies (BMed)\nThe BMed includes Phase 1 and Phase 2. Phase 1 commences with the Foundations course, followed by 7 x 8 week courses focussing on basic medical sciences in relation to the human life cycle; social, ethical and legal issues related to health care; and early experience in clinical or other health-related environments. During this phase, students will undertake a variety of learning activities involving students from different stages of the program working collaboratively in small groups.\nPhase 2 consists of 2 x 16-week courses, with increased clinical content and an emphasis on correlation between prior and current learning.\nDoctor of Medicine (MD)\nThe MD includes the Independent Learning Project (ILP), followed by a Clinical Transition Course prior to the Phase 3 courses. During the Independent Learning Project students should also complete 12 UOC of General Education courses in a faculty or faculties other than Medicine.\nPhase 3 consists of 10 x 8-week courses with a clinical focus, but still includes relevant content from the basic medical sciences and the social sciences. Students are required to complete a course in the disciplines of Internal Medicine, Surgery, Psychiatry, Primary Care, Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Children&#39;s Health (Paediatrics). Students may choose from a range of other available clinical modules to complete Phase 3 requirements. In addition, a student&#39;s clinical experiences during Phase 3 must include a minimum of 4 weeks in a rural location. All clinical courses in Phase 3 adopt the principles of clinical clerkship, in which students learn through experience and participation in the treatment of patients under the care of medical practitioners and/or medical teams to which they are attached.\nStudents who have achieved a high standard in the BMed may undertake a one year program of supervised research leading to the award of the BSc(Med) Honours. Students wishing to undertake a full year of research may be able to enrol in the BSc (Med) Honours program 3831 subject to the approval from the Honours Committee. These students will be exempt from undertaking the Independent Learning Project. Exemption from the Independent Learning Project will also be granted to students who have previously completed a research Honours program or higher research degree, or a Master degree with a significant research component, or who can otherwise demonstrate acceptable evidence of independent study or research at a tertiary level.",
        "structure_summary": "Students must complete 288 UOC when taken as a standalone program.\nThe duration of the integrated Medicine program is normally 6 years. It has a modular structure comprising a series of fully integrated courses studied over 26 teaching periods, generally each of 8 weeks duration. There are 4 teaching periods in Years 1-4 approximating the University semester timetable. There is an additional teaching period (Summer Teaching Period) in years 5-6. In most years, the standard UNSW program load of 48 UOC per year will apply.",

The first option enables students to undertake a coursework intensive program that will reduce the research project to 18 UoC allowing 30 UoC to be undertaken via coursework, from an approved specialisation. The second option is Extended Research and students will select a research project (36 UoC) that aligns with one of our specialisations and 12 UoC derived from coursework.\nThis is a one year research program offered to students in year 4 of the six year Medicine program or Arts/Medicine who have achieved a high standard in their studies. Those who complete the research program in conjunction with the six year curriculum will be eligible for the award of the degree BSc(Med)Hons.\nIn general the aims of the year, normally spent in supervised research, are to enable the student to acquire an appreciation of the value of observation and research in the development of medical science, to determine the &#39;current state of knowledge&#39; in a defined field, to provide experience in the written and spoken presentation of scientific information and scholarly research, and to provide an invaluable background in basic research philosophy and techniques on which a subsequent career in specialised medical research may be built, and develop an understanding of, and ability to interpret research that underpins evidenced-based clinical practice.",

        "overview": "The Bachelor of International Public Health (BIPH) aims to provide students with an understanding of the critical issues impacting the health of populations.\nGlobal health involves taking a worldwide perspective, undertaking action to promote health for all and affects all sectors beyond the medical and health systems.\nThe degree aims to support students in developing in-demand job skills needed to design, develop, and implement public health solutions to global challenges and ensure that they have a social impact.\nStudents will be exposed to various case studies, spanning international contexts and population health issues and priorities.\nThe UNSW Bachelor of International Public Health program is a three-year degree, which can be taken on campus in Sydney or partially or fully online at a relaxed pace (full or part-time). The degree covers the scope and methods of global health. It prepares students to design and implement new public health approaches for emerging health problems, including cardiovascular diseases, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, infectious diseases outbreaks and pandemics, climate-related health issues and other issues. These health problems transcend geographical, cultural, and national boundaries.\nIn the final year of the degree, students will complete two courses delivered by public and global health experts located at Arizona State University (ASU). Students also can select elective courses offered by ASU throughout their degree. This unique partnership, supported by the PlusAlliance network, allows students to expand their understanding of global health issues and meet students located around the world. A highlight of the degree is the Capstone course designed to provide students with an opportunity to apply the public health knowledge and skills gained from their courses to a research project, internship, or public health study abroad tour.\nIn this degree, global health issues and responses are considered in the context of changing patterns of disease and injury of populations within and across countries. By taking a global approach, BIPH students gain a critical awareness of priority health issues and gain skills in developing culturally and socially appropriate health interventions. BIPH graduates will stand out amongst their peers and gain a perspective on global public health, which key employers genuinely value.\nThere s strong demand in Australia and globally for professionals with specialised interdisciplinary skills in international public health. This degree can lead to a career in government departments and ministries of health, public health networks, local area health services, universities and research institutes or international health policy and funding institutions.\nThe BIPH is open to domestic and international students, including those who have recently completed school or mature age entrants, and is designed for those interested in rewarding international opportunities in the health sector, particularly in public health, health promotion, policy and program design, or design community development.",

You will learn about the chemistry of food, availability of nutrients, how these are absorbed into the body and their role in health and wellbeing. Nutrition practice aims to support people to maintain good health by applying knowledge and skills through sociocultural, economic and environmental frameworks operating at local, national and global levels. This program is designed to prepare you for opportunities as a Nutritionist in a range of areas including educating people on general nutrition concepts, designing, and implementing population health initiatives, communication of scientific information to the public and in food industry roles.\nOn successful completion of this program, you will be able to seek accreditation as an Accredited Nutritionist from the Nutrition Society of Australia. Foundation science courses are an important component of the early stages of the Nutrition program and include chemistry, food science, biology and biochemistry. These are followed by courses in physiology, anatomy, nutrition and metabolism. Together with fundamental training in nutrition, food, agriculture, technology and communication in second and third years, there is a strong focus throughout the program on developing critical skills in ethical and empathetic practice, collaborative teamwork, cultural safety and cross-cultural communication, creative and critical thinking and innovative problem solving. These skills align with employer expectations and will enable you to influence, promote change, and solve critical contemporary and future issues in food, nutrition and equity.\nThis program is only available as part of the integrated Bachelor of Nutrition/ Master of Dietetics and Food Innovation double-degree (3894) and is not offered as a separate standalone program for direct entry.",

This program allows students to combine a coherent stream of studies in a contemporary Science discipline with courses that provide a broad background to business and management. Students will study a range of foundation business courses that will provide exposure to several aspects of business practices, and will also have the opportunity to increase their breadth of experience using electives, and select from a limited number of higher year courses to gain a greater understanding of a feature of the commercial domain. The program has been designed for students whose passion is Science, but who also recognise that awareness of contemporary business practices can be vital in the modern workplace.",

It&#39;s designed for talented students and offers the flexibility to tailor the degree in a way that works for them. The degree offers students access to advanced level courses and includes an Honours year. Students will study foundation courses, which may include subjects such as biology, chemistry, physics and maths, before choosing a major (or two) and really explore what inspires them most. In their fourth year, students undertake an Honours year which involves a supervised research project and in some cases, advanced coursework. Outstanding Honours students may continue their studies in a higher research degree.",

It is an industry linked education program leading to the award of the qualification Bachelor of Information Systems (Co-op) (Honours). The program draws on both Information Systems and business and is intended to develop conceptual and practical skills. After an introductory first stage, students will learn about business analysis systems and design, data management, business systems infrastructure and security as well as commercial programming statistics, management accounting and commercial programming.\nThe BIS (Co-op) (Hons) program has been designed in conjunction with Information Systems and Information Technology industry professionals to provide for the needs of Australian businesses. The program combines the requirements for the award of the degree with 18 months of coordinated industrial experience at three different sponsoring organisations (24 weeks at each). Industry Training extends outside university semesters.\nThe program combines courses that assist students to learn about the technical environment of IS as well as develop an understanding of the business implications of these systems. Organisations are always looking for business savvy IS graduates who understand the business and technical issues which surround and impact their information systems. IS graduates from this degree can target careers in areas such as: business systems analysis, information system development, communications networks analysis and development; IS security development; e-business systems development; business intelligence systems construction, and IS and IT architecture and infrastructure development and maintenance.",

The Majors include Biology, Earth Science, Ecology, Environmental Chemistry, Geography and Marine and Coastal Science.\nThe aim of the program is to provide a strong education in the skills and knowledge necessary to work or carry out research as an environmental scientist. In addition to the graduate attributes applicable to\n3970 Bachelor of Science , graduates of the B. Env. Mgmt. will need to be able to place their understanding of the scientific aspects of the environment within the general context of the policy and legal framework of environmental regulations, as well as economic and social dimensions to environmental policy and management. The B. Env. Mgmt. is designed as a 3 year (full-time) program. There is also an opportunity for students to continue onto an Honours year in Program 4500 Science (Honours), if they satisfy the entry requirements (usually a Credit WAM) or to combine the B. Env. Mgmt. with the\nMasters of Environmental Management\n(Program 8623).",

This degree is ideal for students who seek a &#39;generalist&#39; degree in which there is a large element of choice. Students are encouraged to choose a broad range of courses in the first year, to expand their general understanding of Science which then enables them to choose from a wide selection of major options in the second and third year. There is also the option to apply for an additional Honours year at the end of the three years, subject to a student&#39;s academic performance and other criteria. The rules and requirements for the degree are set out below.",

        "overview": "The Bachelor of Information Systems (BIS) is a highly valued and accredited business qualification offering students a career-focused education in Information Systems (IS). Organisations are always looking for &#39;business savvy&#39; IS graduates who understand both the business and technical issues related to their systems. This three-year degree is designed for students interested in the practical application of technology in business and government.\nInformation Systems relates to the interaction between technology, people and processes to achieve business goals. This can include internal applications of technology such as networks and Information Technology (IT) services that help those who work for organisations operate more efficiently, as well as external applications such as technological products and user experiences. IS professionals are in the business of transformation, working in teams to understand data, solve problems, optimise systems, create innovations, and enrich organisational workflows. Through the BIS degree, you will learn from leading academics and business experts in Information Systems to become an adaptive thinker, solve problems through a variety of digital technologies and tools, and drive purposeful change required to thrive in a fast-changing and increasingly digital world.\nThe BIS degree now includes an Integrated First Year (IFY) experience, allowing you to begin your study with other students in the business school. You will learn about business management and the broader environment in which an organisation operates, with a focus on developing professional skills and capabilities. The BIS now also offers a work integrated learning (WIL) course. WIL enables you to engage in\nauthentic, purposeful, partnered, supervised\nand\nassessed\nwork learning experiences that integrate academic learning with its application in the workplace.\nThe core BIS courses cover discipline specific competency areas that prepare you for a career as an IS graduate. This includes the study of\nDesign and Development\nand\nOrganisational IS such as\nBusiness Analysis, Agile Product Management, User Experience (UX) and IT Service Design, IS Project Management, as well as Business Process Management. In addition, you will undertake studies in\nData &amp; Information Management , including courses that will develop your knowledge and skills in Databases (SQL), Database Management, Big Data, and programming for analytics (R and Python). The core IS curriculum also prepares you for a career in Technology/Security related areas of business, and the study of Networking and Security, Cyber Security Management and Governance as well as Enterprise Architecture and Cloud Solutions. Finally, you will conclude your core study of IS through an\nIntegration\nand capstone project course. This course will synthesise your learnings across the program, requiring you to complete an authentic, sandbox project that closely relates to professional and collaborative work in the field. The BIS degree also offers a number of technical elective courses for students looking to further their data analytic or programming skills (Java and Android app development).\nOnce you have successfully completed the BIS degree, you will be able to pursue a career in the following areas: digital transformation, IT consulting, business systems analysis, User Experience (UX) design, information system design, communications network analysis, IS security development, cybersecurity consulting, digital innovation, data science, IS and IT architecture, database administration, and infrastructure development and maintenance.\nHigh performing students can study an additional Honours year for more advanced studies in Information Systems, including the completion of an honours research thesis project.",

The program prepares the students for the role of professional pilot working either as a single pilot in a general aviation organisation, or as a multi-crew team in an airline. In addition, the student undertakes academic courses in aviation management (including safety) so that they may also take on the role of manager or the dual role of pilot/manager. The parallel program, the Bachelor of Aviation Management stream (Program 3981) prepares students more specifically for careers in the managerial sector of the aviation industry.\nBoth streams consist of core courses selected from the Faculties offering the program, together with a range of options. The Flying stream additionally includes flight training to a minimum level of Commercial Pilots Licence (CPL), Instrument Rating - Multi Engine Aeroplane and Air Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL) theory subjects.\nNote : Due to the block training nature of the flight training program, teaching periods might not correspond to standard academic sessions, and\nstudents will need to undertake the Professional Pilot Program (flying training)\non a full-time basis.",

The BSc (International) is thus aimed at providing for the needs of students by preparing them for an increasingly globalised work environment.\nThe program is designed for students wishing to obtain a strong and highly regarded Science program coupled with specific emphasis on cross-cultural skills, knowledge and understanding. The program also provides the knowledge and skills essential for understanding and working in the rapidly changing global environment. It will provide a wide range of career opportunities in global scientific organisations and companies, international government and non-government agencies and in scientific research. The program requires students to undertake a coherent scientific program, achieved by completing a science-based major and adds a series of directed electives to provide a suite of attributes associated with &#39;global education&#39;. The program also places emphasis on cross cultural understanding, competencies in languages and incorporates a period of overseas study. The Faculty provides a contribution to the expenses of this exchange.\nThe objectives of the program are:\nTo graduate scientists with both a breadth and depth of scientific knowledge and professional skills;\nTo develop the capacity for critical thinking and independent learning;\nTo expose students to the social context of science, to the globalization of science, the global issues in science and provide a greater appreciation and sensitivity to the cultural context of knowledge and learning in science;\nTo foster greater cross cultural understanding and the development of international professional networks.",

It provides the basis for a career in biomedical research and is also an appropriate first degree for students planning to enter graduate medical or paramedical programs.\nMedical Science is the area of science which underpins the practice of medicine. It incorporates the study of structure and chemistry of the cells that make up living organisms (Cell &amp; Molecular Biology and Biochemistry) with particular reference to humans, and specifically of the structure and function of the human body (Anatomy and Physiology). It then deals with the general processes leading to disease (Pathology), the role of bacteria, viruses and other micro-organisms in disease (Microbiology) as well as drugs which are used to cure human diseases (Pharmacology). Other areas available for study include the way in which our form and function is inherited (Genetics), the processes of development from the fertilised ovum (Embryology), the natural defences of the body (Immunology) and the study of the structure and function of the brain (Neuroscience).\nStudents completing this program with exceptional performance may have the opportunity to enrol in an Honours program leading to an Honours degree.\nA limited number of high-performing students may be able to gain entry to the UNSW Medicine program with advanced standing. For more information, please\nclick here .\nStudents intending to apply for entry via this pathway must have completed all compulsory courses by the end of Stage 2.",

Students must follow the Handbook of the year they commenced their program, so continuing students should refer to the past edition Handbook\nhere .\nThe Bachelor of Medicinal Chemistry (Honours) is a professionally oriented, truly interdisciplinary program taught as a joint initiative between the Schools of Chemistry and Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences (Faculty of Science), and the Pharmacology section of the School of Medical Sciences (Faculty of Medicine).\nMedicinal Chemistry is an exciting, rapidly-expanding area within the broad discipline of Chemistry that has seen enormous growth recently both within Australia and globally. It is, quite simply, the development of new pharmaceutical agents, from Concept to Clinic. Many different stages are involved; from the design and synthesis of novel drug candidates, to their biochemical effects, testing regimes and regulatory and ethical considerations. The Medicinal Chemistry (Honours) program had been designed to ensure that graduates will have a strong background in contemporary biology, biochemistry and pharmacology, based upon a solid foundation of essential chemistry.\nGraduates from the Medicinal Chemistry(Honours) program will be equipped with a unique and wide harmony of skills, ranging from fundamental chemistry enabling the synthesis and analysis of drug candidates, through to relevant pharmacology and molecular biology skills. This combination will see graduates in high demand both locally and globally in pharmaceutical companies involved in modern drug design. In addition, the multidisciplinary nature of the program will mean that graduates will also be highly marketable within other science-based industries and related fields. The research focus in the Honours year, which provides projects that emphasise the interdisciplinary and collaborative nature of the area, will also enable students to progress seamlessly into a higher degree if they wish.\nGraduates will obtain a broad education across a range of relevant scientific areas, as well as a strong grounding in advanced biological and chemical techniques. There will be particular emphasis on the medical sciences. The first year of the program will provide solid foundation knowledge in some fundamental areas of science, chemistry, mathematics, and biology- as well as specific graduate attributes courses. Year two and three will focus on chemistry, pharmacology, and biochemistry, with a number of recommended electives to broaden a student&#39;s knowledge in relevant fields (physiology, anatomy, genetics). The fourth (Honours) year provides a substantial research experience.",

A separate four-year program at Honours level (Program Code 4511) is also available for eligible applicants.\nA Bachelor of Arts program enriches your understanding of how human beings make, recognise, and debate about life&#39;s meaning and the values that support civilisation. All Arts disciplines teach students to develop their capacity for critical analysis and argument as well as an awareness of the value of language as a political, intellectual, creative and communicative tool.\nStudents can combine courses from Business, English and Media Studies, Indonesian Studies, Geography, History, and International and Political Studies, building expertise in one or more of these disciplines.\nHonours students who are RAN midshipmen or RAAF officer cadets continue with their programs at UNSW, Canberra and complete their degrees at the end of the fourth year. Army officer cadets transfer to the Royal Military College, Duntroon at the end of their third year. After completing a year of military training they are commissioned as lieutenants, and those who are continuing with Honours programs return to the Academy to complete their Honours degree.\nThe objective of a Bachelor of Arts program is to stimulate students intellectually and to immerse them in the discipline of learning.\nThe program will develop graduate attributes, such as strong written and oral communications skills, the capacity to research, criticise and reflect, and the ability to work independently and collaboratively.",

        "overview": "The Bachelor of Science is a three-year program at pass level. A separate four-year program at Honours level (Program Code 4513) is also available for eligible applicants.\nScience is the understanding of the physical universe (from sub-atomic particles and microbes through to the planet s environment and the origin of the universe itself), and human interactions with it. Just as important is the scientific process by which this understanding is gained. In turn, Science is the foundation of the modern technologies that enhance the quality of lives and provide ever more sophisticated means of applying the scientific process. In addition, Science is crucial in control of disease, biotechnology, new sustainable energy sources, information technology, and management of precious natural resources.\nPass-level students in Science should complete their programs within three years. Honours students who are RAN midshipmen or RAAF officer cadets continue with their programs at UNSW Canberra at ADFA and complete their programs at the end of the fourth year. Army officer cadets, however, at the end of the third year transfer to the Royal Military College, Duntroon. After completing a year of military training they are commissioned as lieutenants and those who are continuing with Honours return to the Academy to complete their program.\nA Bachelor of Science program will develop students\nlifetime skills including creativity, problem-solving ability, critical thinking and communication skills that will be useful not only in a scientific environment but in all professions. It will prepare students to deal with technical and management issues that will often require scientific knowledge and the intellectual and practical problem-solving skills developed through studies in physical, environmental and mathematical sciences, and information technology.",

These streams include: foundation science, engineering technology, materials and structures, dynamics and control, thermofluids, design and management as well as discipline-specific streams such as aircraft systems and engines.\nExcept for Electrical Engineering and those in the Chief of Defence Force Students Program, first year technology and engineering students enrol in a common program taking foundation science and engineering courses. In the second and third year, the programs diverge into their specialities although there are some courses that span across programs in all years. A key element in all years is the design stream which emphasises complex problem-solving. Other streams such as aerodynamics, stability, control. thermofluids, structures, mechanics, materials and management often incorporate project-based learning informed by academic research and industrial practice. Electives and a final semester project enable students to pursue particular interests both within and outside the specialist discipline.\nAt the end of the program, students are expected to meet the graduate attributes of the University and Stage 1 Competencies of Engineers Australia, ready to practice in their chosen profession and with the ingenuity and resourcefulness to meet rapid technological change.\nThe BTech (Aero) is primarily designed for officer cadets and midshipmen of the Australian Defence Force who intend to become aircrew and wish to enhance their understanding of the operation and performance of aircraft. It is differentiated from the BTech (Aviation) program by providing a broader engineering technology foundation.",

All programs also include discipline-specific research projects. The research projects will be supervised by academic staff from the relevant discipline. With the approval of the relevant Heads of Schools, multi- or cross disciplinary projects may be undertaken.\nStudents in the research courses may work independently or as part of a team, depending on the nature of the project undertaken, though all students will submit individual assessment. Final assessment will be based on a written paper or report and oral presentations.\nThroughout the program, and in addition to completing the courses given in the following schedules, students will be engaged with cohort activities so as to develop and maintain their interest and continuing involvement in the program via invited lectures, seminars, general reading and social events.\nEach of the CDFS Programs has objectives and learning outcomes in common with the standard Bachelor degree in the same area, but extends the educational principles embodied in the standard degree to a higher level. In the programs, students will be exposed to courses in critical analysis and/or research methods in the discipline(s) of their chosen program, which will offer significant extensions to the ideas and analysis normally available in the standard degree program. This will allow all CDFS to successfully undertake research-oriented courses at the appropriate level through their program, thereby integrating research into their studies in a way that is not available in the standard degree. The individual projects undertaken in close association with academic staff on research topics of mutual interest underpin the CDFS Programs and give students the ability to develop their full potential.",

        "overview": "The Chief of Defence Force Students (CDFS) Programs in Arts, Business, Engineering, Science and Technology - Aeronautical offer the opportunity for students entering UNSW Canberra with a high Entrance Rank, and who maintain a high level of performance in their studies, to undertake research in a range of disciplines that will develop their critical thinking and independent research skills beyond that available in the standard Bachelor Degree programs.\nThe range of CDFS Programs, described in detail in the following sections, is characterised by the inclusion of specialist courses in critical analysis and/or research methods appropriate to the area of study. All programs also include discipline-specific research projects. The research projects will be supervised by academic staff from the relevant discipline. With the approval of the relevant Heads of Schools, multi- or cross-disciplinary projects may be undertaken. Students in the research courses may work independently or as part of a team, depending on the nature of the project undertaken, though all students will submit individual assessment. Final assessment will be based on a written paper or report and oral presentations.\nThroughout the program, and in addition to completing the courses given in the following schedules, students will be engaged with cohort activities so as to develop and maintain their interest and continuing involvement in the program via invited lectures, seminars, general reading and social events.\nThe CDFS Programs are of three-years&#39; duration in Arts, Business, Science and Technology - Aeronautical.\nEach of the CDFS Programs has objectives and learning outcomes in common with the standard Bachelor degree in the same area, but extends the educational principles embodied in the standard degree to a higher level. In the programs, students will be exposed to courses in critical analysis and/or research methods in the discipline(s) of their chosen program, which will offer significant extensions to the ideas and analysis normally available in the standard degree program. This will allow all CDFS to successfully undertake research-oriented courses at the appropriate level through their program, thereby integrating research into their studies in a way that is not available in the standard degree. The individual projects undertaken in close association with academic staff on research topics of mutual interest underpin the CDFS Programs and give students the ability to develop their full potential.",

        "overview": "Engineering degrees offered by UNSW Canberra aim to provide outstanding engineering education to future leaders in the Australian Defence Force and to civilian students to pursue excellence through contributions to research, the profession, industry and the community.\nThe Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Electrical Engineering is of four years duration and the degree may be awarded at Honours Class I, Honours Class II, Division I or Honours Class II, Division II.\nThese Honours levels will be displayed on the final testamur. Candidates who do not achieve Honours Class I or II will receive a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Electrical Engineering with no honours level displayed.\nThe Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Electrical Engineering program at UNSW Canberra has been granted full accreditation by Engineers Australia and has been recognised by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.\nThe Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Electrical Engineering is built on a foundation of mathematics, computing, and physical science. An introduction to electrical engineering is provided through two courses in the first year, with progressively larger components in second and third year. The remaining early year courses consist of programming, mathematics, and physics: these are essential foundations for the later year EE courses.\nThe final year is devoted exclusively to electrical engineering courses. Each year of the program comprises a number of discipline-based courses and courses taught by other discipline areas. Most courses in the first three years of the program are common for all electrical engineering students. In the fourth year, students have the option to select specialty topics in areas such as communications, surveillance and radar, computer engineering and guided weapons electronics.\nElectrical Engineering is one of the newer branches of engineering. It has its origin in the turning to the practical use of the discoveries of Faraday, Ampere, Maxwell and a number of other eminent 19th century physicists. It has remained the most strongly science-oriented branch of engineering and is closely related to computer science. At first, it had its major impact by providing the means for the generation, distribution and utilisation of electric power. While this remains an important sub-area of the whole discipline, the last few decades particularly have seen a rapid and extensive diversification into the fields of computers and control as well as electronics and communications, and beyond them into such areas as biology, medicine and space technology. It is now true to say that there are very few areas of civilised activity that have remained untouched by the ideas and products of modern electrical engineering. The rapid growth in networked devices is driven almost entirely by electrical engineering.\nElectrical engineers work at the intersection of electronics, mathematics, programming, control, and networking, and are thus ideally suited for the problems of the coming decades.",

Each year of the program comprises a number of School-based courses (identified by the prefix ZEIT) and courses taught by other Schools within UNSW Canberra.\nCompletion of each year, thereby allowing progression to the next year, is normally achieved by satisfactory progress in each of the courses given in that year.

Maintaining and operating a flight vehicle requires an understanding of materials, reliability and maintenance, structural analysis for necessary repairs, together with knowledge of the disciplines within the design process.\nExcept for Electrical Engineering and those in the Chief of Defence Force Honours Program first-year engineering and technology students enrol in a common program taking foundation science and engineering courses. In second and increasingly in third and fourth years the programs diverge into their specialities although there are some courses that span across programs in all years. A key element in all years is the design stream which emphasises complex problem-solving. Other streams such as aerodynamics, stability, control, thermofluids, structures, mechanics, materials and management often incorporate project-based learning informed by academic research and industrial practice. Electives and a final year thesis enable students to pursue particular interests both within and outside the specialist discipline.\nAt the end of the program, students are expected to meet the graduate attributes of the University and Stage 1 Competencies of Engineers Australia, ready to practise in their chosen profession and with the ingenuity and resourcefulness to meet rapid technological change.",

        "overview": "Background\nCivil Engineering takes its name from the division of engineering in the Middle Ages between military and civilian works. The profession of Civil Engineering was recognized by the formation of the Institution of Civil Engineers (UK) in 1825. In the 19th Century, the broadening scope of engineering led to the division of civilian engineering into civil, mechanical and electrical, with further specializations (aeronautical, chemical, industrial, materials, electronic etc.) having developed in the 20th Century.\nAfter contracting its sphere of interest over a long period of time, Civil Engineering is now broadening its scope with the recognition of the wider implications of its effects on modern society. Attention is given both to the interaction between civil engineering and other disciplines and to the effect of Civil Engineering works on the environment. Present day civil engineering has maintained strong commonality with military engineering - the design and construction of facilities such as roads, bridges, airfields, buildings, water supply and waste treatment facilities, structures of all types, and the associated planning and management of projects.\nProgram Description\nEngineering degrees offered by UNSW Canberra aim to provide outstanding engineering education to the future leaders of the Australian Defence Force and civilian students to pursue excellence through contributions to the engineering profession, industry and the community.\nThe Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Civil Engineering program is of four years duration and the degree may be awarded at Honours Class I, Honours Class II, Division I or Honours Class II, Division II. These honours levels will be displayed on the final testamur. Candidates who do not achieve Honours Class I or II will receive a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Civil Engineering with no honours level displayed.\nThe engineering programs at UNSW Canberra have been granted full accreditation by Engineers Australia.\nIn the first year, students will complete most fundamental science, mathematics and computing courses. During the second and third years, students will be required to complete all core civil engineering courses in areas of structures, construction materials, geotechnics, transportation, hydraulics and environmental engineering. In the final year, all students will complete both final year thesis and integrated design project to enhance their skills in solving complex civil engineering problems. Furthermore, all students will also take two technical electives which will further enhance their technical knowledge in specific areas of civil engineering.",
        "structure_summary": "Students must complete 192 UOC when taken as a standalone program.\nThe prescribed program structure of the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Civil Engineering degree is shown below. Each year of the program comprises a number of School-based courses (identified by the prefix ZEIT) and courses taught by other Schools within UNSW Canberra.\nCompletion of each year, thereby allowing progression to the next year, is normally achieved by satisfactory progress in each of the courses given in that year. At the discretion of the Head of School, students may be allowed to concurrently enrol in courses from more than one year of the program.\n1. Core Courses - 162 UOC 2.

        "overview": "All engineering degrees within UNSW Canberra aim to provide outstanding engineering education to the future leaders of the Australian Defence Force and civilian students to pursue excellence through contributions to the engineering profession, industry and the community.\nThe Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Mechanical Engineering is of four years duration, and the degree may be awarded at Honours Class I, Honours Class II, Division I or Honours Class II, Division II.\nThese honours levels will be displayed on the final testamur.\nCandidates who do not achieve Honours Class 1 or 2 will receive a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Mechanical Engineering with no honours level displayed.\nMechanical Engineering is the branch of engineering that is concerned with machines and the production of power, and particularly with forces and motion. It became a separate branch of engineering in the early 1800s, when steam power began to be used in manufacture and transportation.\nOne can identify four functions that are common to all branches of mechanical engineering.\nThe first is the understanding of and dealing with the bases of mechanical science. These include dynamics, concerning the relationship between forces and motion, such as vibration; automatic control: thermodynamics, dealing with the relations among the various forms of heat, energy, and power; fluid flow; heat transfer; lubrication; and properties of materials.\nSecond is the sequence of research, design, and development. This function attempts to bring about the changes necessary to meet present and future needs. Such work requires not only a clear understanding of mechanical science and an ability to analyse a complex system into its basic factors, but also the originality to synthesise and invent.\nThird is production of products and power, which embraces planning, operation and maintenance. The goal is to produce the maximum value with the minimum investment and cost while maintaining or enhancing longer term viability of the enterprise or the institution.\nFourth is the co-ordinating function of the mechanical engineer, including management, consulting and, in some cases, marketing.\nIn all of these functions there is a long continuing trend towards the use of scientific instead of traditional or intuitive methods. Operations research, value engineering and reliability centred maintenance are typical titles of such new rationalised approaches. Creativity, however, cannot be rationalised. The ability to take the important and unexpected step that opens up new solutions remains in mechanical engineering, as elsewhere, largely a personal and spontaneous characteristic.\n(The above description was adapted from the Encyclopedia Britannica).\nExcept for Electrical Engineering and those in the Chief of Defence Force Honours Program first-year engineering and technology students enrol in a common program taking foundation science and engineering courses. In second and increasingly in third and fourth years the programs diverge into their specialities although there are some courses that span across programs in all years. A key element in all years is the design stream which emphasises complex problem solving. Other streams such as stability, control, thermofluid dynamics, structures, mechanics, materials and management often incorporate project based learning informed by academic research and industrial practice. Electives and a final year thesis enable students to pursue particular interests both within and outside the specialist discipline.\nAt the end of the program students are expected to meet the graduate attributes of the University and Stage 1 Competencies of Engineers Australia, ready to practice in their chosen profession and with the ingenuity and resourcefulness to meet rapid technological change.",

        "overview": "The Chief of Defence Force Honours Program in Engineering offers the opportunity for students entering UNSW Canberra with a high Entrance Rank, and who maintain a high level of performance in their studies, to undertake research in a range of disciplines that will develop their critical thinking and independent research skills beyond that available in the standard Engineering program.\nCommencing in Year 2, the research projects, each offered as separate courses, will be supervised by academic staff from the same or closely related discipline. Students in the research courses may work independently or as part of a team, depending on the nature of the project undertaken, though all students will submit individual assessment. Final assessment, due by the end of semester, will be based on a written paper and an oral presentation.\nThe Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) (CDF) in Electrical Engineering is built on a foundation of mathematics, computing science and physical science. The program is specifically designed for undergraduate students who have shown academic excellence in their studies and it incorporates significant elements of training in research methods at all years of the program. A small component of electrical engineering is introduced in the first year, with progressively larger components in second and third year. The final year is almost exclusively devoted to electrical engineering courses. Each year of the program comprises a number of discipline-based courses, courses taught by other discipline areas and problem-based learning courses.\nElectrical Engineering is one of the newer branches of engineering. It has its origin in the turning to practical use of the discoveries of Faraday, Ampere, Maxwell and a number of other eminent 19th century physicists. It has remained the most strongly science-oriented branch of engineering. At first it had its major impact by providing the means for the generation, distribution and utilisation of electric power. However, while this remains an important sub-area of the whole discipline, the last few decades particularly have seen a rapid and extensive diversification into the fields of computers and control as well as electronics and communications, and beyond them into such areas as biology, medicine and space technology. It is now true to say that there are very few areas of civilised activity that have remained untouched by the ideas and products of modern electrical engineering. The absorption of recent scientific development has been very rapid and has demanded a fully developed scientific outlook on the part of electrical engineers for a proper understanding of the problems involved. Many devices, scarcely more than laboratory prototypes a decade ago, are now in widespread use as fully engineered hardware.\nThe Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) (CDF) in Electrical Engineering has program objectives and learning outcomes in common with the standard Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Electrical Engineering program. The program extends the educational principles embodied in the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Electrical Engineering) to a higher level of the degree. In the program, students will be exposed in first year to research methods in Engineering and will be offered significant extensions to the ideas and analysis performed in the standard degree program. This will allow them to undertake research projects, at the appropriate level, in their later years, thereby, more fully integrating research into the standard coursework undergraduate degree. The individual projects undertaken in close association with academic staff on research topics of mutual interest underpin the program and give the students the ability to develop their full potential.",

These three categories of marine vehicles can be in the form of a monohull (the usual single-hull ship or boat), a multihull catamaran or trimaran (a twin or triple hull vessel), or dynamically supported craft such as hovercraft (an air-cushion vehicle) or hydrofoil (a vessel that is lifted out of the water by submerged wings).\nNaval architects must be conversant with a wide variety of skills, including most forms of engineering and marine architecture. A ship must be a completely self-sufficient vehicle containing several systems and able to withstand the loads from the sea.\nNaval architecture firms and consultants are significant employers of naval architects. Naval architects working in the field of high-speed ferries have been particularly successful. Australia holds the leading position in the research and development of passenger and cargo multihulls.\nThe Commonwealth Department of Defence White Paper (2016) reaffirmed the Government s commitment to a strong, internationally competitive and sustainable Australian naval shipbuilding industry which will rely heavily on naval architects. The Commonwealth s Naval Shipbuilding Plan (2017) identified naval architects as key enablers in the Australian naval shipbuilding workforce. Employment of naval architects within the defence sector occurs within the Department of Defence and the RAN.\nIn addition, federal and state government departments and statutory authorities such as AMSA and state transport departments employ naval architects, as do international classification societies such as Lloyd s Register, DNV and Bureau Veritas.\nGraduates of the program are expected to meet UNSW Graduate Capabilities embodied in the Program Learning Outcomes and Engineers Australia Stage 1 Competencies.",

Students in the research courses may work independently or as part of a team, depending on the nature of the project undertaken, though all students will submit individual assessment. Final assessment, due by the end of semester, will be based on a written paper and an oral presentation.\nThe Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) (CDF) in Naval Architecture program has objectives and learning outcomes in common with the standard Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Naval Architecture program.\nThe program extends the educational principles embodied in the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Naval Architecture to a higher level of the degree. In the program, students will be exposed to research methods in Engineering and will be offered significant extensions to the ideas and analysis performed in the standard degree program. This will allow them to undertake research projects, at the appropriate level, in their later years, thereby, more fully integrating research into the standard undergraduate degree. The individual projects undertaken in close association with academic staff on research topics of mutual interest underpin the program and give the students the ability to develop their full potential.\nNaval Architecture is concerned with the design, building and utilisation of all types of ships and marine vehicles.\nShips and marine vehicles can be classified into military vessels which include frigates, destroyers, patrol vessels, aircraft carriers, mine hunters and submarines; trading vessels which include cargo and container ships; and commercial vessels which include fishing boats, tugs, dredges, pilot boats, lighthouse supply craft, servicing vessels for oil rigs, crew transfer, passenger and vehicle ferries, floating cranes, and other specialised ships and pleasure craft.

Honours is a means for connecting undergraduate study with supervised independent research by consolidating and extending work completed in the undergraduate program and providing an academic foundation for students continuing on to a Masters by research or a PhD.\nAs part of the honours program students will be expected to complete a significant independent research project and may be expected to complete coursework. As the Faculty has a diverse range of disciplines the exact proportion of research-based work and coursework may differ by School. Students should refer to the plan pages in this Handbook for details of the different Honours programs.\nIn addition to conducting research and coursework students will generally also be expected to undertake Occupational Health &amp; Safety (OH&amp;S) training, attend and present seminars, write a literature review, and write a thesis.",

Honours is a means for connecting undergraduate study with supervised independent research by consolidating and extending work completed in the undergraduate program and providing an academic foundation for students continuing on to a Masters by coursework, a Masters by research, or a PhD.\nStudents conduct a year-long, 30 UOC major independent research project (completed under the guidance of an academic supervisor), and write a thesis based on the project. In addition, students complete 18 UOC of advanced-level core and elective coursework in both Term 1 and Term 2.\nThe research project may be undertaken in most areas of psychology, such as: psychopathology, behavioural neuroscience, cognitive science, cognition and perception, forensic psychology, and social, personality and developmental psychology. The project culminates in a written thesis, which is assessed independently by two academics (neither of which is the student&#39;s supervisor).\nThe coursework requirement includes content that encompasses history, professional ethics, evidence-based practice and advanced coverage of selected contemporary issues in psychology that reflect the expertise and research specialisations of School staff.\nThe Honours year commences in late January/early February and is undertaken full-time over one year.

Building upon the\ndisciplinary foundation in knowledge, literacy and skills of the Bachelors degree, the Honours year enables academic excellence, social engagement and global perspective to a level where graduates are prepared for transition to professional practice. The Honours program is also a\nmeans of connecting undergraduate study with supervised independent research by consolidating and extending work completed in the undergraduate program and providing an academic foundation for students who may wish to a Masters by research or a PhD program.",

If you commenced in a prior year please refer to the Online Handbook in the year you started your Law degree or contact the Faculty of Law for advice.\nThis program combines the professional LLB program with Bachelor of Medicinal Chemistry (Honours). Medicinal Chemistry (Honours) is an exciting, rapidly-expanding area within the broad discipline of Chemistry that has seen enormous growth recently both within Australia and globally. It includes the development of new pharmaceutical agents, from Concept to Clinic. Many different stages are involved; from the design and synthesis of novel drug candidates, to their biochemical effects, testing regimes and regulatory and ethical considerations. The Medicinal Chemistry (Honours) program had been designed to ensure that graduates will have a strong background in contemporary biology, biochemistry and pharmacology, based upon a solid foundation of essential chemistry. Combining this with a Bachelor of Laws also equips students with an understanding of the law, important in this industry, and provides graduates with a degree that is recognized as satisfying the academic requirements for admission as a legal practitioner in NSW.\nDuration The program is a six and a half year full-time combined program leading to the award of the two degrees of Bachelor of Medicinal Chemistry (Honours) and Bachelor of Laws.",

        "overview": "This Handbook is for commencing students. If you commenced in a prior year please refer to the Online Handbook in the year you started your Law degree or contact the Faculty of Law and Justice for advice.\nThis program provides students with an opportunity to obtain two degrees of professional importance to the public sector, criminal justice, community service, business and law practice. Career opportunities include criminal justice agencies such as the Attorney-General&#39;s department, Police, Prisons; Customs; ASIO; Magistrates, District and Supreme Courts; Australian Bureau of Statistics; and practising as a criminal law barrister. In addition, graduates may also undertake analytical and research work in a wide range of areas from aspects of law such as sentencing and punishment to the social causes of a range of crimes from domestic violence to terrorism.\nThe Bachelor of Criminology &amp; Criminal Justice (BCCJ) is an innovative and interdisciplinary field of study with a real world focus designed to explore your interests in crime, deviance, social control and the legal system. Contemporary criminological scholars investigate a broad range of topics including justice, conflict, risk, security, policing, state crime, alternative justice systems, criminalisation and regulation. Key concerns include the nature of crime, how crime is defined and measured, why people commit crime and how societies might respond. Criminologists tackle &#39;real world&#39; social problems including victimisation, juvenile justice, drug-related harm, community safety, indigenous justice, organised crime and corrections. Criminology is shaped by scholars in law, philosophy, psychology and sociology, and other interdisciplinary fields including history, politics, economics, architecture, and cultural studies. The UNSW BCCJ also provides you with the skills of applied social research and policy analysis.",

If you commenced in a prior year please refer to the Online Handbook in the year you started your Law degree or contact the Faculty of Law for advice.\nThis program combines the professional LLB program with Bachelor of Science and Business. The Bachelor Science and Business has been developed to provide a new generation of scientists for today&#39;s increasingly competitive and business-aware world. This program allows students to combine a coherent stream of studies in a contemporary Science discipline with courses that provide a broad background to business and management. Students will study a range of foundation business courses that will provide exposure to several aspects of business practices, and will also have the opportunity to increase their breadth of experience using electives, and select from a limited number of higher year courses to gain a greater understanding of a feature of the commercial domain. The program has been designed for students whose passion is Science, but who also recognise that awareness of contemporary business practices can be vital in the modern workplace.\nDuration/Award The program is a six year full-time combined program leading to the award of the two degrees of Bachelor of Science and Business and Bachelor of Laws (BSc&amp;Bus LLB).",

The three-year Bachelor of Data Science and Decisions has been developed to train scientists to meet the current, and future, strong demand for Data Scientists and Data Analysts. The combination with Law creates an opportunity for graduates to gain skills in both domains, which is increasingly important as data science and data analysis plays a growing role in legal practice and the legal system more broadly.",

As well as a professional qualification, it will add further intellectual dimensions to the study of PPE.\nBPPE provides graduates with a uniquely powerful combination of intellectual tools with which to understand and act on the world. PPE graduates globally are recognised leaders in all aspects of public life, including the highest reaches of government, political parties and lobby groups, the public service, NGOs, and social activist organisations. It also equips students for careers in consultancy work and strategic advising to major corporations. PPE graduates are also well known as public commentators on contemporary issues. The PPE will help you bring the perspectives of three crucial intellectual disciplines to pressing contemporary national and global issues such as justice, inequality and climate change. As well as combining a carefully chosen combination of existing courses from the Politics and International Relations, Philosophy, and Economics streams, the program will include courses specifically designed to enable you to explore the synergies and tensions between them and assess their relevance to meeting humanity&#39;s most difficult challenges.\nDuration/Award\nThe program is a six year full-time combined program leading to the award of the two degrees of Bachelor of Politics, Philosophy and Economics and Bachelor of Laws (BPPE LLB).",
