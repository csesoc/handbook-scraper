As such, many fields of science involve an understanding and/or application of chemistry or materials derived from chemical processes. Since the mid-20th century six notable Australians have won Nobel prizes for their contributions to science , which involved significant aspects of chemistry. These include Sir John Cornforth; and for Medicine with a substantial chemistry component - Florey (1945), - MacFarlane Burnett (1960), - Eccles (1963), - Doherty (1996) and - Blackburn (2009). W.H. Bragg, W.L Bragg won the prize in Physics (1915), which led to major advances in chemistry, biology and material science.</p>\n\n<p>Chemistry has prominence in the modern world via applications involving nanotechnologies and popular compact electronic devices of everyday use. However, there are many more chemical uses that that support modern society and occupy many roles without being noticed or even pondered.</p>\n\n<p>Chemistry is science at the molecular level. Chemical science underpins defence technology at every level from lasers and high-speed computers to food science and energetic materials. Ordnance and Engineering are particular areas where UNSW Canberra Chemistry majors have found employment.</p>\n\n<p>Chemistry is divided into several sub-fields. The School of PEMS has strengths in Physical and Theoretical Chemistry as well as Inorganic and Organic Chemistry. Within each of these sub-fields there are specialist fields of laser spectroscopy, biological chemistry, supramolecular chemistry, explosives and molecular design. As well as teaching, academic staff carry out research in these fields. Fourth year Honours and higher degree by research (MSc, PhD) programs are available within a range of specified areas.</p>\n",

However, anatomy today is much more than the descriptive study of the dissected body, although dissected specimens, along with immersive technologies such as virtual reality, are used for research and instruction. The study of anatomy now embraces separate but strongly related disciplines: gross anatomy deals with the description of form, arrangement and function of the bones, joints, muscles and internal organs, together with their blood and nerve supply; histology deals with the microscopic structure of tissues and cells; embryology is concerned with the normal development of the embryo and fetus from conception to birth and with the mechanisms of development and malformations; neuroanatomy deals with the internal organisation and functions of the brain and spinal cord; biological anthropology involves applying biological principles and approaches to the study of humans &amp; non-human primates.</p>\n<p>We are ranked 41 (2020) in the world for anatomy and physiology. At UNSW, all anatomy courses have a strong emphasis on living anatomy with functional and clinical significance of the structures in health and in disease. Anatomy is also applied to related disciplines of biomedical engineering, medical imaging and diagnostic technology, and the virtual and augmented reality.</p>\n<p>Careers in anatomy include medicine, medical research, neuroscience, reproductive technologies (IVF) and allied health disciplines such as Physiotherapy and Exercise Physiology. You could pursue a career as a radiographer forensic anthropologist, immersive (VR, AR) developer, and a data specialist. Studying anatomy also prepares students well for careers in medicine and is especially relevant clinical skills, surgery and radiological imaging.</p>\n<p>Anatomy may be combined with elective courses in Biochemistry, Physiology, Microbiology, Pathology or Psychology.</p>",

Honours in Palaeoscience introduces undergraduate students to research and project work of relevance to various endeavours in the physical environmental sciences including archaeology, evolutionary anthropology, palaeoclimate, palaeoecology, palaeontology and past human environmental interactions and hazards. Students undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations. The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning this program is centred on Honours students taking on their role as a researcher to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge with some degree of independence. The program, run over three sessions, includes a Research Proposal (which may include an extended literature review and a risk management component) and a substantial independent Research Project under the close supervision of academics within the School of BEES. These components are complemented by more formal seminars and workshops, focusing on graduate attributes (scientific communication, risk management, ethics and professional development) as well as School (and Institute/Centre) seminars.</p>",

Entry is also possible to students from other cognate disciplines at the discretion of the Program Convener or the School of BEES Honours Coordinator. External students are welcome into all School of BEES Honours Programs but require approval of the Honours Coordinator and will require evidence of the completion of equivalent study.</p>\n<p>Students seeking to enrol in Honours are required to have completed a total of 144 units of credit and all the requirements for the Bachelor of Science (or equivalent). Admission into the BEES Honours Program is subject to academic performance and the number of places available in the School&#39;s Honours Program. Typically students require a Credit average (\u226565% weight average mark; WAM) in their undergraduate degree for entry into Honours. Where students have an overall WAM that is less than, but close to a Credit, the School of BEES may take into consideration a student&#39;s academic performance in their Major area of study when assessing an application for Honours.</p>\n<p>Students must apply to the School of BEES for admission to enrol in the Honours program: admission requirements and the number of places available are determined by the Head of School or nominee and are subject to the availability of resources. All decisions regarding admission to the School of BEES Honours Program are final.</p>\n<p><em>Admission Process</em></p>\n<p>Potential students must first apply for acceptance into the School of BEES Honours Program and into the Palaeoscience stream and, following receipt of an offer of acceptance, students can proceed with enrolment. Application and Enrolment procedures are described on the <a href=\"http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">BEES Honours Program</a> webpage. It is highly recommended that students approach possible Honours Supervisors well before the deadlines to discuss potential Research Projects: supervisors and potential projects can also be found on the BEES Honours webpage. Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via <a href=\"http://research.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">UNSW Research</a>. Students should then download and complete an application form and submit it to the BSB Student Office before the submission deadline. <strong>Please note:</strong> this application must include an offer to supervise the Research Project as is detailed in the application form. Students accepted into the Program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the School of BEES Honours Program in Geography are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students who successfully complete the BEES Honours Program receive some Advanced Standing in the <a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/programs/current/8623.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Master of Environmental Management</a> (Program 8623) and students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.</p>\n<p>Graduates of the BEES Honours Program are also well qualified to work in various endeavours. Past graduates have found employment in the private sector (e.g. resource and environmental management companies, environmental consultancies etc.) and in the public sector (local, state or federal government agencies and regulatory bodies). Potential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought after: in particular Honours students are equipped with advanced disciplinary knowledge, project design and management skills, consideration of Occupational Health and Safety issues and advanced (written and verbal) communication skills.</p>",

As a student studying the Indigenous Studies Major, you will be led in a sequential way to understand that solutions in practice requires deep, ongoing, critical reflection at the level of theory and practice.</p>\n<p>The learning experience across the levels has been configured to allow for transferability of skills and knowledge into other contexts.</p>\n<p>You will begin by focusing on the continuities of Indigenous ways of understanding the world. In this way you will be drawn into an awareness of Indigenous knowledge and tradition as an organiser of Indigenous worlds and continuing Indigenous practices. This alerts you to your prior assumptions, positions the contests that occur within Indigenous Studies, and prepares you for deeper intellectual inquiry at levels two and three.</p>\n<p>The Indigenous Studies Major culminates in a capstone course, where you will practice navigating a range of issues potentially encountered in the workplace. Understanding Indigenous knowledge and practice, and the historical relations between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia are required for comprehension of the complex mix of continuities, ruptures and convergences that condition the contemporary Indigenous position and how it can be understood.</p>\n<p>The Indigenous Studies Major is designed for those of you seeking to specialise in Indigenous Studies as the central focus of your degree program.

Students are assessed based on their ability to articulate verbally the significance of their findings, an understanding of the methods they employed, an ability to answer questions, and a background understanding of the field of study.</p>\n\n<p>Contribution to final grade: 10%</p>\n\n<p><strong>Honours Grade Calculation</strong></p>\n\n<p>Hons. Class I (\u2265 85%)</p>\n\n<p>Work of excellent critical evaluation through substantial independence and self-direction, reflecting superior quality in all aspects of research, writing and presentation. The work has no significant errors or/and deficiencies.</p>\n\n<p>Hons. Class II, Division I (75% to 84%)</p>\n\n<p>Work of very good critical evaluation through substantial independence and self-direction, reflecting very good quality in all aspects of research, writing and presentation.</p>\n\n<p>Hons. Class II, Division 2 (65% to 74%)</p>\n\n<p>Work of good quality in research, writing and presentation but with some significant errors or/and deficiencies.</p>\n\n<p>Hons. Class III (50% to 64%)</p>\n\n<p>Work is in acceptable form and demonstrates basic research, writing and presentation skills. The work has several significant deficiencies.</p>\n\n<p>Fail (&lt;50%)</p>\n\n<p>Work has a number of major flaws and there is evidence of lack of basic knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>The thesis will be reviewed by at least two internal reviewers other than the supervisor(s). A panel will then determine the allocation of final honours grade.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Admission Requirements and Process</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Requirements</em></p>\n\n<p>Admission to Honours is competitive, and depends on academic merit as well as the availability of an approved supervisor. Consideration of academic merit is focused on performance in third level Science subjects and overall WAM, and students must meet all requirements of their undergraduate degree (stages 1 to 3) before being considered eligible.</p>\n\n<ul><li>Students with an average overall WAM of lower than 65/or an average of lower than 65 in third-level Science courses will usually not be accepted.</li><li>Students who have achieved an average overall WAM of 65 or higher and an average of 65 or higher in third-level Science courses may be admitted if an approved supervisor is available</li></ul>\n\n<p>The major of a current BABS undergraduate student will normally determine their Honours category, but there is some flexibility depending on the student\u2019s interests and availability of supervisors. UNSW Medical Science students (3991 program) and graduates from other Australian or overseas universities are welcome to apply for the BABS Honours program. Their selected research project will determine the Honours area in which they enrol.</p>\n\n<p><em>Process</em></p>\n\n<p>Students who meet the entry requirements, or expect to do so, should make contact with potential supervisors. Further information about staff research interests and the process of applying for Honours can be found <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/how-apply-honours-mphil-babs\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and appropriate links on the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/future-honours-students\" rel=\"nofollow\">School of BABS webpage</a>. Following this, students should contact undergraduate student office and complete an honours application form before the due date.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students with successful honours may be qualified to enrol in postgraduate level studies (Master of Philosophy, Master of Science by research or Ph.D.), depending on the level of honours obtained and the area in which research is to be undertaken. Further information can be gained from School of BABS webpage:<a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au\" rel=\"nofollow\"> www.babs.unsw.edu.au</a></p>\n\n<p>Graduates of honours degree in Bioinformatics may find employment in research, government and industry. Past graduates of honours in Bioinformatics have found employment in all of the above sectors.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n",

The BABS BSc (Hons) Degree provides an opportunity for students to experience hands-on scientific research. Honours students become part of a research team within one of the research labs in the School, and complete a supervised research project and thesis during the year-long program.</p>\n\n<p>A key benefit of the Honours year is that it provides for a different type of learning experience. It proceeds at the pace of the individual student, with suitable supervisory oversight providing relevant training in an informal, relaxed atmosphere. Honours is also an opportunity for the student to undertake measured and reflective decision making about their future scientific career. Examples of recent projects and further information regarding Honours in Molecular and Cell Biology can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/future-honours-students/honours-mphil-projects\" rel=\"nofollow\">Honours and MPhil Projects</a> page on the BABS website.</p>\n\n<p>Honours in Molecular and Cell Biology is to be completed full-time. Students commence their enrolment in Term 1 (T1) or Term 2 (T2) or Term 3 (T3). Students should check with the undergraduate school administrator and honours coordinator for current enrolment deadlines and completion dates.</p>\n\n<p>Students must enrol in BABS4516 BABS Honours\u00a0 (16 UOC) for three terms.</p>\n\n<p>The program involves a research project that forms the majority of the assessment. The project, although supervised, is to be completed with substantial independence and self-direction. In addition, the program involves a series of student consultations, tutorials and seminars. Students should seek to meet with other School researchers and academics to stimulate research ideas and aid the research process. Honours Students must attend a series of compulsory workshops on ethics, research design, data analysis, thesis writing, presentation skills and publishing (see Assessment below).</p>\n",

Consideration of academic merit is focused on performance in third level Science subjects and overall WAM, and students must meet all requirements of their undergraduate degree (stages 1 to 3) before being considered eligible.</p>\n\n<p>Students with an average overall WAM lower than 65 and/or an average of lower than 65 in third-level Science courses will usually not be accepted.</p>\n\n<p>Students who have achieved an average overall WAM of 65 or higher and an average of 65 or higher in third-level Science courses may be admitted if an approved supervisor is available.</p>\n\n<p>The major of a current BABS undergraduate student will normally determine their Honours category, but there is some flexibility depending on the student\u2019s interests and availability of supervisors. UNSW Medical Science students (3991 program) and graduates from other Australian or overseas universities are welcome to apply for the BABS Honours program. Their selected research project will determine the Honours area in which they enrol.</p>\n\n<p><em>Process</em></p>\n\n<p>Students who meet the entry requirements, or expect to do so, should make contact with potential supervisors. Further information about the process of applying for Honours can be found here <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/how-apply-honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/how-apply-honours</a>, and other appropriate links on the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/future-honours-students\" rel=\"nofollow\">School of BABS</a> website. Following this, students should contact undergraduate student office and complete an honours application form before the due date (typically February for S1 and June for S2).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students with successful honours may be qualified to enrol in postgraduate level studies (Master of Philosophy, Master of Science by research or Ph.D.), depending on the level of honours obtained and the area in which research is to be undertaken. Further information can be gained from the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">School of BABS</a> website.</p>\n\n<p>Graduates of honours degree in Molecular and Cell Biology may find employment in research, government and industry.

It offers a general introduction to the discipline during the first years of study and then allows students to diversify into the more specialised areas of genetics, including molecular genetics, human genetics, bioinformatics, plant and microbial molecular biology, conservation biology, etc. Molecular biology has had a major impact on this discipline and is ideal for those students whose interests are in understanding and appreciating biological processes at the molecular rather than the descriptive level. The study of genetics has taken a more computer/systems approach and the major has a significant focus in this discipline integration of these approaches at the cellular and molecular level.",

The BABS BSc (Hons) Degree provides an opportunity for students to experience hands-on scientific research. Honours students become part of a research team within one of the research labs in the School, and complete a supervised research project and thesis during the year-long program.</p>\n\n<p>A key benefit of the Honours year is that it provides for a different type of learning experience. It proceeds at the pace of the individual student, with suitable supervisory oversight providing relevant training in an informal, relaxed atmosphere. Honours is also an opportunity for the student to undertake measured and reflective decision making about their future scientific career.

The project, although supervised, is to be completed with substantial independence and self-direction. In addition, the program involves a series of student consultations, tutorials and seminars. Students should seek to meet with other School researchers and academics to stimulate research ideas and aid the research process.

Honours in Biology introduces undergraduate students to research and project work of relevance to various endeavours in the biological sciences. Students undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations. The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning this Program is centred on Honours students taking on their role as a researcher to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge with some degree of independence. The Program, run over three sessions, includes a a Research Proposal (which may include an extended literature review and a risk management component) and a substantial and independent Research Project conducted under the close supervision of academic(s) within The School of BEES. These components are complemented by more formal seminars and workshops, focusing on graduate attributes (scientific communication, risk management, ethics and professional development) as well as School (and Institute/Centre) seminars.</p>\n",

Admission into the BEES Honours Program is subject to academic performance and the number of places available in the School&#39;s Honours Program. Typically students require a Credit average (\u226565% weight average mark; WAM) in their undergraduate degree for entry into Honours. Where students have an overall WAM that is less than, but close to a Credit, the School of BEES may take into consideration a student&#39;s academic performance in their Major area of study when assessing an application for Honours.</p>\n<p>Students must apply to the School of BEES for admission to enrol in the Honours Program: admission requirements and the number of places available are determined by the Head of School or nominee and are subject to the availability of resources. All decisions regarding admission to the School of BEES Honours Program are final.</p>\n<p><em>Admission Process</em></p>\n<p>Potential students must first apply for acceptance into the School of BEES Honours Program and into the Biology stream and, following receipt of an offer of acceptance, students can proceed with enrolment. Application and Enrolment procedures are described on the <a href=\"http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">BEES Honours Program</a> webpage. It is highly recommended that students approach possible Honours Supervisors well before the deadlines to discuss potential Research Projects: supervisors and potential projects can also be found on the BEES Honours webpage. Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via <a href=\"http://research.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">UNSW Research</a>. Students should then download and complete an application form and submit it to the BSB Student Office before the submission deadline: <strong>Please note:</strong> that this application must include an offer to supervise the Research Project as is detailed in the application form. Students accepted into the program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the School of BEES Honours Program are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students who successfully complete the BEES Honours Program in Biology receive some Advanced Standing in the <a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/programs/current/8623.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Master of Environmental Management</a> (Program 8623) and students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.</p>\n<p>Graduates of the BEES Honours Program are also well qualified to work in various endeavours. Past graduates have found employment in the private sector (e.g. resource and environmental management companies, environmental consultancies etc) and in the public sector (Local, State or Federal government agencies and regulatory bodies). Potential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought after: in particular Honours students are equipped with advanced disciplinary knowledge, project design and management skills, consideration of Occupational Health and Safety issues and advanced (written and verbal) communication skills.</p>",

The BABS BSc (Hons) Degree provides an opportunity for students to experience hands-on scientific research. Honours students become part of a research team within one of the research labs in the School, and complete a supervised research project and thesis during the year-long program.</p>\n\n<p>A key benefit of the Honours year is that it provides for a different type of learning experience. It proceeds at the pace of the individual student, with suitable supervisory oversight providing relevant training in an informal, relaxed atmosphere. Honours is also an opportunity for the student to undertake measured and reflective decision making about their future scientific career. Examples of recent projects and further information regarding Honours in Biotechnology can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/future-honours-students/honours-mphil-projects\" rel=\"nofollow\">Honours and MPhil Projects</a> page on the BABS website.</p>\n\n<p>Honours in Biotechnology is to be completed full-time.\u00a0Students commence their enrolment in Term 1 (T1) or Term 2 (T2) or Term 3 (T3). Students should check with the undergraduate school administrator and honours coordinator for current enrolment deadlines and completion dates.</p>\n\n<p>Students must enrol in BABS4516 BABS Honours\u00a0 (16 UOC) for three terms.</p>\n\n<p>The program involves a research project that forms the majority of the assessment. The project, although supervised, is to be completed with substantial independence and self-direction. In addition, the program involves a series of student consultations, tutorials and seminars. Students should seek to meet with other School researchers and academics to stimulate research ideas and aid the research process. Honours Students must attend a series of compulsory workshops on ethics, research design, data analysis, thesis writing, presentation skills and publishing (see Assessment below).</p>\n",

Consideration of academic merit is focused on performance in third level Science subjects and overall WAM, and students must meet all requirements of their undergraduate degree (stages 1 to 3) before being considered eligible.</p>\n\n<p>Students with an average overall WAM of lower than 65/or an average of lower than 65 in third-level Science courses will usually not be accepted.</p>\n\n<p>Students who have achieved an average overall WAM of 65 or higher and an average of 65 or higher in third-level Science courses may be admitted if an approved supervisor is available.</p>\n\n<p>The major of a current BABS undergraduate student will normally determine their Honours category, but there is some flexibility depending on the student\u2019s interests and availability of supervisors. UNSW Medical Science students (3991 program) and graduates from other Australian or overseas universities are welcome to apply for the BABS Honours program. Their selected research project will determine the Honours area in which they enrol.</p>\n\n<p><em>Process</em></p>\n\n<p>Students who meet the entry requirements, or expect to do so, should make contact with potential supervisors.

Following this, students should contact undergraduate student office and complete an honours application form before the due date.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students with successful honours may be qualified to enrol in postgraduate level studies (Master of Philosophy, Master of Science by research or Ph.D.), depending on the level of honours obtained and the area in which research is to be undertaken. Further information can be gained from the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">School of BABS</a> website.</p>\n\n<p>Graduates of honours degree in Biotechnology may find employment in research, government and industry.

        "description": "<p>Chemical Product Engineering involves researching, developing and improving the properties of the products that we use every day through the selection and design of the materials that are used. Product engineers work on the fluids that you use in your everyday life, including chemicals (cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, shampoos, paints, glues), foods, and drinks. As a product engineer, you will learn to take consumer needs and turn them into technical requirements, finding the right combinations of chemicals to deliver those properties and then developing the product and strategies for commercialisation and manufacture. You will learn how to apply your knowledge of engineering and chemistry to design complex chemical products for the pharmaceutical, consumer products and food industries. You&#39;ll master the entire development process, testing out ideas for products and extrapolating small scale, laboratory chemistry into large, industrial scale production. In the final year Product Design Project, you will work with industry partners to develop a new consumer product up to the point where it could be patented and commercialised. To get work ready, you&#39;ll apply these skills through 60 days of approved industry training.<br /><br />The courses listed below have to be completed to finish the degree, but the order in which they are taken is important and you need to follow advice on this. Many courses are offered only once per year and others have pre-requisites or exclusions which govern the order in which they can be taken. Both of these things can have a big impact on enrolment planning if poor choices of course combinations are made. You are strongly encouraged to consult the School website and follow the recommended course sequence linked <a href=\"https://www.engineering.unsw.edu.au/study-with-us/undergraduate-degrees/chemical-product-engineering\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.<br /><br />The timing of the general education courses and elective courses may be modified to optimise your choice of courses. It is your responsibility to plan your enrolment appropriately. Assistance is available from Engineering Student Support Services, should you require it.</p>",

Students in Chemistry Honours undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations.<br />\n<br />\nThe learning and teaching philosophy underpinning Chemistry Honours is centred on students taking on their &#39;role as a researcher&#39; to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge, with some degree of independence.<br />\n<br />\nIn addition to the research project, Chemistry Honours includes formal coursework and requires attendance at School seminars, aimed at broadening a graduate&#39;s knowledge. Most students would complete Honours as full-time students, where the program is completed over two consecutive semesters. Part-time study is also possible depending on availability of supervision and suitable projects.<br />\n<br />\nStudent research projects are available across the full range of Chemistry disciplines, with a focus on our School\u2019s major research themes of Catalysis and Energy, Nanoscience, and Medicinal Chemistry. Further information on the Honours program and the School\u2019s research can be found on the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.chemistry.unsw.edu.au/current-students/undergraduate/honours-research\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chemistry Honours</a>\u00a0page and the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.chemistry.unsw.edu.au/research/research-themes\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chemistry Research Themes</a>\u00a0page.<br />\n<br />\nMost students commence their enrolment in a trimester (commonly T1 and T3). Students are expected to commence work on their project in Week 1 of their first trimester. Honours typically runs until mid-November (T1 commencement) or end of their final trimester. Students should check the Chemistry Honours webpages for current enrolment deadlines, and assessment and completion dates.<br />\n<br />\nThe Chemistry Honours stream involves undertaking a research project that, although conducted under supervision, contains substantial independent research and self-direction. The research project is described in a submitted Project Thesis that forms the largest component of the assessment. The Project Thesis is complemented by introductory written and oral background presentations, oral presentation of the research project, and an oral examination (viva voce). Students are also required to attend compulsory Workplace Health and Safety training, relevant inductions, as well as School seminars.<br />\n<br />\nThe Chemistry Honours stream also contains an advanced coursework component. Students elect to study a series of advanced topics covering a broad range of chemistry.</p>\n",

Students must also give a short seminar based on the review and proposal, highlighting any strengths and limitations of relevant literature. The proposal is graded by a panel of up to 4 academics and the seminar is graded by the academics in the audience for their presentation (minimum of 4).<br />\n<br />\nThis component of the Honours year is complemented by essential workplace health and safety and other relevant inductions, and compulsory instruction on topics including preparation of research proposals, and ethics.<br />\n<br />\nAssessable components:<br />\nProject proposal: 60% (7.5% of final Honours mark)<br />\nIntroductory Seminar: 25% (3.125% of final Honours mark)<br />\nHealth &amp; Safety / Ethics Quiz: 15% (1.875% of final Honours mark)<br />\nResearch Project Thesis (36 UOC)<br />\n<br />\nA Research Project is the major undertaking of a student\u2019s Honours year, and students enrol in a combination of courses (CHEM4506, CHEM4512, CHEM4518 as described above for full-time and part-time enrolment, to a total of 36 UOC). At the conclusion of the project a student will submit a written manuscript or thesis (maximum 50 pages) summarising the research and results obtained during their Honours year. The Project Thesis will be marked by a panel of up to four assigned examiners. A critical part of the evaluation of the Thesis will include assessment of a student\u2019s research performance throughout the year including motivation, organisational skills, research (laboratory) skills, note-keeping, critical analysis and communication skills.<br />\n<br />\nStudents are also required to deliver a formal 20 minute presentation covering the results of the research, and to defend their research in an oral examination.<br />\n<br />\nAttendance at School seminars is also a compulsory part of the Honours program.<br />\n<br />\nThe breakdown of assessment for the Research Project Thesis mark is as follows:<br />\nThesis mark 60% (45% of final Honours mark)<br />\nFinal seminar 15% (11.25% of final Honours mark)<br />\nOral examination 25% (18.75% of final Honours mark)<br />\nHonours Grade Calculation<br />\n<br />\nA student\u2019s Honours mark is the Weighted Average Mark (WAM) of the marks obtained in CHEM4501 Chemistry Project Proposal and Research Skills (6 UOC), CHEM4502 Chemistry Honours Coursework (6 UOC), plus the Research Project (36 UOC).<br />\n<br />\nThe overall contributions of the various components to the final Honours grade are as follows:<br />\nHonours Coursework (12.5%)<br />\nProject Proposal and Research Skills (12.5%)<br />\nResearch Project Thesis (75%)<br />\nA guide to allocation of Honours classes and what is expected of students within the School of Chemistry is as follows:<br />\n<br />\nFinal Mark &gt;85 (Honours Class 1)<br />\n<br />\nWork of superior quality in all aspects of research, scientific writing, and oral presentation, demonstrating the ability to organise information in a clear and concise manner, the integration of information from a wide range of sources and containing clear examples of excellent critical evaluation.<br />\n<br />\nFinal Mark 75-84 (Honours Class 2.1)<br />\n<br />\nWork of very good quality in all aspects of research, scientific writing, and oral presentation, but showing lesser ability to organise information in a clear and concise manner, integrate information from range of sources and critically evaluate the literature and research data.<br />\n<br />\nFinal Mark 65-74 (Honours Class 2.2)<br />\n<br />\nGood quality in all aspects of research, scientific writing, and oral presentation but with inadequacies in understanding, critical skills, organisation and presentation.<br />\n<br />\nFinal Mark 50-64 (Honours Class 3)<br />\n<br />\nAdequate quality work with significant deficiencies in understanding, critical skills, organisation and presentation.<br />\nAdmission Requirements and Process<br />\n<br />\nAdmission Requirements<br />\n<br />\nThe Chemistry Honours stream in Program 4500 Science (Honours) is available to all students who have met the entry requirements outlined below and is typically offered to 3970 Science, 3987 Science International and 3925 Science and Business students at UNSW who have completed a Chemistry major including students enrolled in dual program combinations with these Science programs (see the UNSW Online Handbook for details). Exceptions to these requirements will only be permitted with the consent of the Head of School or nominee (Honours Coordinator). External students should provide evidence of equivalent study and will require approval of the Head of School or nominee (Honours Coordinator).<br />\n<br />\nOther requirements for entry to Honours in Chemistry are as shown below:<br />\nA credit average (&#61;65% WAM) for all undergraduate Science courses.<br />\nA credit average for all Level II and III courses in the Chemistry major.<br />\nAn applicant with an overall WAM of between 60 to 64 will require the permission of the Head of School to enrol in Honours in Chemistry.<br />\nAdmission Process<br />\n<br />\nStudents who meet the entry requirements should make contact with potential supervisors aligning with their interests and discuss undertaking Honours with them. Potential students should then apply for acceptance into the stream and, following receipt of an offer of acceptance, proceed with enrolment.

Students accepted into the program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.<br />\n<br />\nSupervisors and potential projects can also be found on the Chemistry Honours page. Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via the Chemistry Research page.<br />\nPathways<br />\n<br />\nStudents who successfully complete Chemistry Honours are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students with successful Honours are qualified to enrol in a PhD program at UNSW. Students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies. Further information can be obtained from the postgraduate studies page.<br />\n<br />\nGraduates of Chemistry Honours are well qualified to work in any Chemistry or associated research laboratory as a Research Assistant or Research Technician. Graduates may also find employment in the public or private sectors either using their chemistry skills directly, or alternatively in a range of other fields using the analytical and research skills developed during the Honours year. For more information see the School of Chemistry\u2019s Careers page.<br />\n<br />\nPotential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought.</p>\n",

The Chinese Studies major at UNSW encompasses the study of Chinese language and communication as well as culture, society and civilisation, including Chinese literature, cinema, history, politics and philosophy. A background in Chinese Studies is useful in many areas of professional specialisation, from commerce and the business sector to tourism, the media, the public service sector and education.<br /><br />There are two main components of Chinese Studies. The first is a focus on the acquisition of competence in the Chinese language. Acquiring language competence involves a wide range of knowledge and understanding of socio-cultural conventions as well as skills in self-expression, both oral and written, and skills in comprehending others\u2019 expression, both oral and written. The ability to read written texts is an important part of this process. The second component is the study of aspects of the cultures and societies associated with the Chinese language. We draw upon other disciplines in order to inform an understanding of Chinese culture. These disciplines include literary, cultural, film, translation, gender, and media studies as well as anthropological, linguistic, historical and sociological approaches.<br /><br />This specialisation is available to students commencing at Introductory and Intermediate entry levels.</p>",

The Advanced Chinese Studies major specialisation at UNSW encompasses the study of Chinese language and communication as well as culture, society and civilisation, including Chinese literature, cinema, history, politics and philosophy. A background in Chinese Studies is useful in many areas of professional specialisation, from commerce and the business sector to tourism, the media, the public service sector and education.<br /><br />There are two main components of Chinese Studies. The first is a focus on acquiring / enhancing competence in the Chinese language. Language competence involves a wide range of knowledge and understanding of socio-cultural conventions as well as skills in self-expression, both oral and written, and skills in comprehending others\u2019 expression, both oral and written. The ability to read written texts is an important part of this. The second component is the study of aspects of the cultures and societies associated with the Chinese language.

Honours in Climate Science introduces undergraduate students to research and project work of relevance to various endeavours in climate dynamics, global climate change, and extremes of weather and climate. Students undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations. The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning this program is centred on Honours students taking on their \u2018role as a researcher\u2019 to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge with some degree of independence. The program, run over three sessions, includes a Research Proposal (which may include a literature review and a risk management component) and a substantial\u00a0 independent Research Project under the close supervision of academics in the school of BEES. These components are complemented by more formal seminars and workshops, focusing on graduate attributes (scientific communication, risk management, ethics and professional development) as well as School (and Institute/Centre) seminars.</p>",

Entry is also possible for students from other cognate disciplines at the discretion of the Program Convener or the School of BEES Honours Coordinator. External students are welcome into all School of BEES Honours Programs but require approval of the Honours Coordinator and will require evidence of the completion of equivalent study.<br /><br />Students seeking to enrol in Honours are required to have completed a total of 144 units of credit and all the requirements for the Bachelor of Science (or equivalent). Admission into the BEES Honours Program is subject to academic performance and the number of places available in the School&#39;s Honours program. Typically students require a Credit average (\u226565% weight average mark; WAM) in their undergraduate degree for entry into Honours. Where students have an overall WAM that is less than, but close to a Credit, the School of BEES may take into consideration a student&#39;s academic performance in their Major area of study when assessing an application for Honours.<br /><br />Students must apply to the School of BEES for admission to enrol in the Honours program: admission requirements and the number of places available are determined by the Head of School or nominee and are subject to the availability of resources. All decisions regarding admission to the School of BEES Honours program are final.<br /><br /><em>Admission Process</em><br /><br />Potential students must first apply for acceptance into the School of BEES Honours Program and into the Climate Science stream and, following receipt of an offer of acceptance, students can proceed with enrolment. Application and Enrolment procedures are described on the BEES Honours Program webpage (<a href=\"http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours</a>). It is highly recommended that students approach possible Honours Supervisors well before the deadlines to discuss potential Research Projects: supervisors and potential projects can also be found on the BEES Honours webpage. Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via UNSW Research (<a href=\"http://research.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">research.unsw.edu.au</a>). Students should then download and complete an application form and submit it to the BSB Student Office before the submission deadline.\u00a0<strong>Please note</strong>\u00a0that this application must include an offer to supervise the Research Project as is detailed in the application form. Students accepted into the Program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.<br /><br /><strong>Pathways</strong><br /><br />Students who successfully complete the School of BEES Honours Program are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students who successfully complete the BEES Honours Program in Climate Science receive some Advanced Standing in the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/programs/current/8623.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Masters of Environmental Management</a>\u00a0(Program 8623) and students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.<br /><br />Graduates of the BEES Honours Program are also well qualified to work in various endeavours. Past graduates have found employment in the private sector (e.g. resource and environmental management companies, environmental consultancies etc.) and in the public sector (local, state or federal government agencies and regulatory bodies). Potential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought after: in particular Honours students are equipped with advanced disciplinary knowledge, project design and management skills, consideration of Occupational Health and Safety issues and advanced (written and verbal) communication skills.</p>",

How database systems are applied can critically affect the success of an organisation. In the future, the management of very large volumes of organisational data will be an essential component of the livelihood and growth of every organisation.<br />\n<br />\nSince databases are so widely used, potential employers include any organisation that relies on the effective management of data. Obvious examples of large organisations with significant data management needs are financial institutions, telecommunications companies, manufacturing enterprises, and government departments. However, employment is not limited to such organisations, since data management is also critical in medium and small enterprises, such as scientific research labs and small businesses.<br />\n<br />\nThe Database Systems stream in the Computer Science program exposes students both to the foundations of DBMS architecture (essential knowledge for database administrators) as well as to the principles behind leading edge applications of databases, such as e-Commerce, data warehousing, and data mining.",

Many systems, from search engines to financial systems and health systems employ AI techniques such as machine learning. While true &#39;intelligence&#39; via computers is still remote, AI techniques are increasingly being used to enhance the performance of a vast range of existing systems, and to enable new applications, especially those involving large amounts of data.<br />\n<br />\nIn many applications (e.g. driverless vehicles), AI allows existing systems to work with less and less manual intervention. As autonomous devices become more common, potential employers include companies that can make ready use of automation. This includes companies concerned with home and office automation, entertainment companies and autonomous systems research and development. Autonomous systems and the sophisticated sensors they employ are also adopted in many industries to enhance production and to improve safety (e.g. mining, manufacturing, transport).<br />\n<br />\nThis stream introduces students to the foundations of artificial intelligence and the core technologies (machine learning, knowledge representation) that are required to apply AI in the real world.",

This is a high demand area of employment and is forecast to have serious undersupply of graduates to at least 2025. The cyber security education design is based on the security approaches of Ross Anderson and Bruce Schneier and incorporates an explicit engineering focus to security, rather than the more usual ad hoc &#34;hacker&#34;?, or commercial &#34;responsive&#34;? approaches of cyber security education.<br />\n<br />\nThe core courses in the stream teach analysis and systematic professional approaches to engineering security and examine failures, bugs, and human / system interactions and issues. There is an ongoing focus on security by design and professional ethical security practice.<br />\n<br />\nSpecialist elective courses allow students to specialise in their areas of interest and skill. Graduates of the stream are equipped for careers in penetration testing, incident response, software assessment, malware analysis, forensics, military or law enforcement, security consulting, and security lead in dev teams. This stream relies on students being exposed to C and to secure coding and vulnerabilities in first year including: memory use (data representation, the heap, function calls and the stack), and some assembly.",

Over the past 50 years, criminology has evolved into a rich, broad-based discipline, no longer narrowly focused on crime and punishment. Contemporary criminological scholars investigate a broad range of topics including justice, conflict, risk, security, insurance, policing, governance and regulation. Criminology is shaped not only by scholars in law, philosophy, psychology and sociology, but also those in history, politics, economics, architecture, cultural studies, and other interdisciplinary fields.<br />\n<br />\nThe major stream in Criminology will provide you with an advanced understanding of crime and justice issues in contemporary society. At UNSW we use an interdisciplinary approach that integrates disciplinary knowledge from Sociology, Psychology, History, Law and Policy Studies, to provide a critical and theoretically informed understanding of crime and the justice system, criminal law and procedures, criminological research methods, as well as a range of current issues with respect to social control, juvenile justice, human rights, regulation, and penal policy. A major stream in Criminology pairs well with a minor stream in Politics and International Relations or Sociology and Anthropology.</p>\n",

Contemporary criminological scholars investigate a broad range of topics including justice, conflict, risk, security, insurance, policing, governance and regulation. Criminology is shaped not only by scholars in law, philosophy, psychology and sociology, but also those in history, politics, economics, architecture, cultural studies, and other interdisciplinary fields.<br />\n<br />\nCriminology aims to provide you with a critical and informed understanding of crime and justice issues in contemporary society. At UNSW we use an interdisciplinary approach that integrates disciplinary knowledge from Sociology, Psychology, History, Law and Policy Studies, to provide a critical and theoretically informed understanding of crime and the justice system, criminal law and procedures, criminological research methods, as well as a range of current issues with respect to social control, juvenile justice, human rights, regulation, and penal policy.</p>\n",

The interdisciplinary environment at UNSW will also help you forge links with other areas of creative production such as screen writing, media and performing arts.</p>\n<p>Through workshop-based core courses at each level of the major, you will learn how to generate, draft, revise and edit your own writing, and to locate that writing in the context of both literary history and current literary trends. You will be exposed to new experimental techniques of writing and given the opportunity to reflect on how you want to contribute to literary culture. At the same time you will hone your critical and analytical skills to enable you to appraise and assess both your own work and the work of other writers.</p>\n<p>Prescribed electives at each level are offered to complement your writing with a more formal knowledge of literary genres and movements. The major challenges you to integrate a rigorous critical competency in areas such as poetics and narrative theory into the aesthetic choices you make as a writer. It also challenges you to consider the broader cultural and political implications of those choices and to imagine how you can engage with critical ideas and social debate through and in your own writing. Electives in other disciplines offer the opportunity to extend your writing skills in other media forms and establish formal connections with majors in film studies, media studies, and theatre and performance studies.</p>",

Graduates completing the Humanitarian Engineering minor are engineers who can address problems in disadvantaged communities and societies around the world. The Humanitarian Engineering minor will let you combine your skills as an Engineer with skills in humanitarian practice to address problems relating to inequities and lack-of-access to essential services in alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the Sendai Framework and international humanitarian relief efforts. Students complete a humanitarian fundamentals core as well as Development Studies elective to provide them with the context and key principles, and then extend this in their choice of another elective and a self-chosen project course. Students are strongly encouraged to approach the Minor convener with a proposal for their 4th\u00a0year thesis topic if they are considering deepening their humanitarian project into a larger research project, or if they wish to substitute another project for ENGG4102.\u00a0There are a number of <a href=\"https://www.challeng.unsw.edu.au/vertically-integrated-projects/explore-vertically-integrated-projects\" rel=\"nofollow\">VIP projects\u00a0</a>that can be substituted for the project or elective requirement for the Minor.

Honours in Environmental Management introduces undergraduate students to research and project work of relevance to various endeavours in the biological, ecological and environmental sciences. Students undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations. The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning this Program is centred on Honours students taking on their role as a researcher to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge with some degree of independence. The Program, run over three sessions, includes a a Research Proposal (which includes an extended literature review and a risk management component) and a substantial independent Research Project\u00a0 under the close supervision of academics in the School of BEES. These components are complemented by more formal seminars and workshops, focusing on graduate attributes (scientific communication, risk management, ethics and professional development) as well as School (and Institute/Centre) seminars.</p>\n",

Entry is also possible for students from other cognate disciplines at the discretion of the Program Convener or the School of BEES Honours Coordinator. External students are welcome into all School of BEES Honours Programs but require approval of the Honours Coordinator and will require evidence of the completion of equivalent study.</p>\n<p>Students seeking to enrol in Honours in Environmental Management must have satisfied the minimum requirements of a three year Bachelor degree in Environmental Management (or equivalent). Admission into the BEES Honours Program is subject to academic performance and the number of places available in the School&#39;s Honours program. Typically students require a Credit average (\u226565% weighted average mark; WAM) in their undergraduate degree for entry into Honours. Where students have an overall WAM that is less than, but close to a Credit, the School of BEES may take into consideration a student&#39;s academic performance in their Major area of study when assessing an application for Honours.</p>\n<p>Students must apply to the School of BEES for admission to enrol in the Honours program: admission requirements and the number of places available are determined by the Head of School or nominee and are subject to the availability of resources. All decisions regarding admission to the School of BEES Honours program are final.</p>\n<p><em>Admission Process</em></p>\n<p>Potential students must first apply for acceptance into the School of BEES Honours Program and into the Environmental Management stream and, following receipt of an offer of acceptance, students can proceed with enrolment. Application and Enrolment procedures are described on the BEES Honours Program webpage (<a href=\"http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours</a>). It is highly recommended that students approach possible Honours Supervisors well before the deadlines to discuss potential Research Projects: supervisors and potential projects can also be found on the BEES Honours webpage. Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via UNSW Research (<a href=\"http://research.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">research.unsw.edu.au</a>). Students should then download and complete an application form and submit it to the BSB Student Office before the submission deadline.\u00a0<strong>Please note</strong>\u00a0that this application must include an offer to supervise the Research Project as is detailed in the application form. Students accepted into the Program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the School of BEES Honours Program are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students who successfully complete the BEES Honours Program in Environmental Management receive some Advanced Standing in the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/programs/current/8623.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Masters of Environmental Management</a>\u00a0(Program 8623) and students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.</p>\n<p>Graduates of the BEES Honours Program are also well qualified to work in various endeavours. Past graduates have found employment in the private sector (e.g. resource and environmental management companies, environmental consultancies etc.) and in the public sector (local, state or federal government agencies and regulatory bodies). Potential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought after: in particular Honours students are equipped with advanced disciplinary knowledge, project design and management skills, consideration of Occupational Health and Safety issues and advanced (written and verbal) communication skills.</p>",

The most well-known examples are payment systems (PayPal, WeChat, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency), portfolio management and Robo-advice (US, Europe, Australia), peer-to-peer lending (US, China, India and elsewhere), high-frequency trading (global), and decentralized finance (of which Bitcoin and cryptocurrency form the foundation). Established financial services firms (BigTech) and entrepreneurs (FinTech) both demand talent in this space as FinTech products are by nature scalable and have potential for huge impact in a financial services business.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Co-developed with financial services industry experts, this major introduces students to finance theory, financial products, markets, and institutions, then explores how big data and other technologies allow FinTech start-ups to cause consumers to shift away from traditional finance - fundamentally changing the way money is raised, transferred, stored, loaned, and invested around the world. In addition to a conceptual understanding of finance theory, financial markets, and financial services firms, students will experience FinTech courses via the Integrated Learning Laboratory (iLab). They will be able to gain personal access to financial market data platforms, handle financial market and unstructured data, learn how financial products work via the Python programming language, trade using the leading stock trading platform used by brokerage firms, and interact with practitioners.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The Bachelor of Commerce (Financial Technology) major can be taken standalone or be taken to complement other streams of studies such as finance, information system, computer science, engineering, law, and more. It is also available as a minor for students with a constrained degree program.</p>\n",

As a food engineer, you are responsible that food and drink products are of high quality, safe, and healthy, working towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) to improve global food systems, reduce their impact on global warming and optimize the use of water and energy. Your knowledge of chemical engineering, chemical product engineering or manufacturing engineering brings valuable skills to transform the food industry, allowing you to effectively scale food production while ensuring that our food supports and improves both individual and planetary health. You will work with food scientists, food technologists, nutrition professionals, product developers and marketers to innovate and develop new food products and processes. Food processing at scale requires the understanding of the core subjects from your engineering Honours stream, while also understanding the biological complexities of foods. Foods are perishable having a certain shelf life, they are ingested with the purpose of nourishment and enjoyment \u2013 so processing must retain, or enhance, their nutritional characteristics. As a graduate from this stream, you will be a sought-after professional who can excel in food manufacturing, with unique skills, able to lead multidisciplinary teams that work towards nourishing the world\u2019s growing population.</p>",

These changes, among many others, at their most fundamental are about social and environmental dynamics and their relationship across space and time. The field of geography is strongly situated to analyse these dynamics, drawing insights from social and physical sciences. Given this set of disciplinary skills, geographers are employed in a range of different professions, including urban management, regional planning, environmental assessment, advocacy and international development, and education.</p>\n<p>Courses in the minor will provide you with a critical understanding of the human and physical basis of geography. Its offerings will provide also you with diverse opportunities for field trips, conducting data analysis, engaging with policy debates and interrogating key sub-fields within the broader geographical discipline. The wide range of\u00a0courses on offer also means that you will be able to tailor your degree around broader themes such as \u2018development geographies\u2019, \u2018international geographies\u2019 \u2018geohumanities\u2019 the \u2018physical environment\u2019 and \u2018environmental geography\u2019.\u00a0</p>",

Students accepted into the Program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the School of BEES Honours Program are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students who successfully complete the BEES Honours Program in Geology receive some Advanced Standing in the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/programs/current/8623.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Master of Environmental Management</a>\u00a0(Program 8623) and students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.</p>\n<p>Graduates of the BEES Honours Program are also well qualified to work in various endeavours. Past graduates have found employment in the private sector (e.g. resource and environmental management companies, environmental consultancies etc.) and in the public sector (local, state or federal government agencies and regulatory bodies). Potential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought after: in particular Honours students are equipped with advanced disciplinary knowledge, project design and management skills, consideration of Occupational Health and Safety issues and advanced (written and verbal) communication skills.</p>",

This approach aims to enable you to achieve a high level of communicative competence in German while offering you a critical understanding of this fascinating modern European society. You will not only develop your knowledge of the German language, but also gain intercultural awareness and understanding of Germany. Learning German will provide you with a privileged form of access to the cultural resources and complex patterns of life in Germany. Developing competence in German will have an important place in promoting relationships and mutual understanding between countries and peoples.</p>\n<p>In the advanced sequence you will, and in the intermediate sequence you may, complete some components of your sequence via cross-institutional study. You are responsible for enrolling yourself before the appropriate UNSW and partner university deadlines for cross-institutional enrolment, which fall well before the beginning of regular UNSW teaching periods. See <a href=\"https://student.unsw.edu.au/cross-institutional-study\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cross Institutional Study</a>.</p>\n<p>Each course of cross-institutional study requires approval from the appropriate UNSW convenor, with whom you must consult at an early stage to discuss your selection of courses. Once you have successfully completed German Studies courses cross-institutionally, you will have your results reported as transfer credits at UNSW, i.e. specific grades will not appear on your transcript.</p>\n<p>If in a given term you are unable to take appropriate courses cross-institutionally, you may be eligible to apply for an individual variation of your program.</p>\n<p><strong>Placement Information</strong></p>\n<p>If you have prior language knowledge you will need to take an online placement evaluation so that we can assess your skills and select an appropriate level of course for you. Information about the evaluation and additional course details can be found on the web at: <a href=\"http://hal.arts.unsw.edu.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">hal.arts.unsw.edu.au</a></p>\n<p>You will not be permitted to enrol in language courses that are too easy for you.

This stream aims to prepare a graduate for a broad range of career opportunities in the various branches of Surveying and the numerous Spatial Information disciplines. To this end the stream covers general scientific and IT principles, as well as specialised Surveying and Spatial Information topics. Specialisation is provided for through the provision of elective courses offered in the third and fourth years of the program and the choice of a targeted final year thesis project often aligned with an external industry partner. <br /><br />The degree of BE in Surveying is recognised by the Board of Surveying and Spatial Information of New South Wales as meeting the requirements for entry as a candidate to become a Registered Surveyor. The degree is also recognised by the Institution of Surveyors, New South Wales, the Spatial Sciences Institute and Engineers Australia, for admission as corporate members.<br /><br />Suggestions for course sequences consistent with timetabling and availability can be found on the School website The timing of the general education courses and elective courses may be modified to optimize the student&#39;s choice of courses. While some courses are given twice a year, many courses are given only once a year. In addition, courses may have prerequisites and exclusions. Thus students should plan their enrolments appropriately.<br /><br /></p>",

Our expert knowledge covers Australia, the Pacific, the United States, Europe and most of Asia. Our world class historians at UNSW are known for their strengths in world history, in histories of migration, gender and empire, and histories of our region. You will have the opportunity to be taught by historians who are research leaders in their fields, as well as dedicated teachers. We begin with a global outlook from which you will embark on a rich and invigorating program of study which includes options to study ancient, early modern and modern history and from courses in Asian, European, Australian and Gender Studies, many of which have a strong historical emphasis. The minor specialisation in History will equip you with both solid historical knowledge and skills of research and analysis, all of which are highly applicable in many workplaces and interdisciplinary contexts.</p>",

Through provisions of Australia-Japan contact situations, students gain intercultural awareness and understanding, develop their knowledge of the language, cultures, societies and communities in Japan. The Japanese language plays a key role in expressing the cultures and identities of Japan. Japan is of increasing fundamental importance to Australia for political, strategic and economic reasons in realisation of Australia in the Asian Century. Thus, learning Japanese and developing competence in Japanese will provide students a privileged form of access to the cultural resources and complex patterns of life in Japan and beyond, take an important role in promoting relationships and mutual understanding between countries and peoples.</p>\n\n<p>Aims of the Major</p>\n\n<p>There are two main components of Japanese Studies. The first is a focus on the acquisition of competence in the target language. Acquiring target language competence involves a wide range of knowledge and understanding of sociocultural conventions as well as skills in self-expression, both oral and written, and skills in comprehending other&#39;s expression, both oral and written. The second component is the study of aspects of the cultures and societies associated with the Japanese language. We draw upon other disciplines in order to inform understanding of Japanese culture. These disciplines include linguistic, literary, cultural, historical and social productions. Via the study of the Japanese language and associated disciplines, we aim:</p>\n\n<ol><li>to foster an awareness of Japan&#39;s culture, history and society,</li><li>to develop informed understanding of human experiences, cultures, and societies in Japan,</li><li>to enable students to place contemporary Australian society and culture in an historical and comparative context vis a vis Japanese culture and society,</li><li>to develop the skills of critical, creative, and imaginative thinking about Japanese culture and society,</li><li>to promote the techniques and value of reasoned and open-minded discussion and debate,</li><li>to nurture positive attitudes toward intercultural communication in general and with the Japanese,</li><li>to promote learner autonomy.</li></ol>\n\n<p>This stream is available to students commencing at Introductory and Intermediate entry levels.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Placement Information</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students who wish to enrol in a language course without completing the necessary prerequisites are required to complete an online placement application form before the commencement of the term.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, please see the\u00a0<a href=\"http://hal.arts.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">School Website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For students admitted in their first year of study to ARTS2630 or higher on the grounds of ability and/or previous study, such courses will be counted as Level 1 courses in terms of degree requirements.</p>\n",

Through provisions of Australia-Japan contact situations, students gain intercultural awareness and understanding, develop their knowledge of the language, cultures, societies and communities in Japan. The Japanese language plays a key role in expressing the cultures and identities of Japan. Japan is of increasing fundamental importance to Australia for political, strategic and economic reasons in realisation of Australia in the Asian Century. Thus, learning Japanese and developing competence in Japanese will provide students a privileged form of access to the cultural resources and complex patterns of life in Japan and beyond, take an important role in promoting relationships and mutual understanding between countries and peoples.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aims of the Major</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are two main components of Japanese Studies. The first is a focus on the acquisition of competence in the target language. Acquiring target language competence involves a wide range of knowledge and understanding of sociocultural conventions as well as skills in self-expression, both oral and written, and skills in comprehending other&#39;s expression, both oral and written. The second component is the study of aspects of the cultures and societies associated with the Japanese language. We draw upon other disciplines in order to inform understanding of Japanese culture. These disciplines include linguistic, literary, cultural, historical and social productions. Via the study of the Japanese language and associated disciplines, we aim:</p>\n\n<ol><li>to foster an awareness of Japan&#39;s culture, history and society,</li><li>to develop informed understanding of human experiences, cultures, and societies in Japan,</li><li>to enable students to place contemporary Australian society and culture in an historical and comparative context vis a vis Japanese culture and society,</li><li>to develop the skills of critical, creative, and imaginative thinking about Japanese culture and society,</li><li>to promote the techniques and value of reasoned and open-minded discussion and debate,</li><li>to nurture positive attitudes toward intercultural communication in general and with the Japanese,</li><li>to promote learner autonomy.</li></ol>\n\n<p>This stream is available to students commencing at Advanced and Professional entry levels.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Placement Information</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students who wish to enrol in a language course without completing the necessary prerequisites are required to complete an online placement application form before the commencement of the term.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, please see the\u00a0<a href=\"http://hal.arts.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">School Website</a>.</p>\n",

The second component is the study of aspects of the cultures and societies associated with the Japanese language. We draw upon other disciplines in order to inform understanding of Japanese culture. These disciplines include linguistic, literary, cultural, historical and social studies.</p>\n<p>This specialisation is available to students commencing at Advanced and Professional entry levels.</p>",

The five core courses included as part of this stream have been designed on the basis of world best practice in manufacturing and industrial engineering and reflect a top-down - bottom-up approach, spanning the disciplines of Strategy and Management, Operations and Supply Chains, Analysis and Decision-making, Design of Product-Process Systems and Technology &amp; Automation.<br />\n<br />\nWithin each discipline area this new stream will cover many conceptual and analytical techniques, all supporting fact- and data-based analysis and decision making with the aim of improved product and process performance, economy and sustainability. This stream is designed to help you to learn how to transform a design from a conceptual stage into a prototype and ultimately into a commercially realisable and viable product. This stream focuses on technical as well as commercial aspects and particularly in developing the ability to build a business or commercial case for making engineering related decisions, such as investment in plant, equipment and processes. Although the main emphasis will be on product and process, consideration will also be given to designing compatible and appropriate engineering support services. The stream also emphasises the strategic impact of operations decisions and the interfaces between operations and the other functional areas of organisations, including of course, finance. This stream encompasses the key elements of operations management and investment analysis and pulls them together in a coherent format that allows you to understand the &#39;big picture&#39; as well as &#39;the specific details&#39;. It is aimed at integrating the knowledge gained from the mechanical engineering courses you have studied into a framework and process that allows you to implement your designs, solutions and ideas in a commercial environment.<br />\n<br />\nMechanical engineers have traditionally played the major role in the analysis and design of complex machinery, devices such as actuators and sensors, as well as energy transformation, heat transfer and electro-mechanical processes. In an environment of global competition, sustainability (energy, environment as well as cost and capital), increasingly complex customer requirements and statutory regulations as well as the increasing pace of technological change and new product innovation, it is vital for modern engineers to possess the skills to not only design but equally importantly, implement and realize their designs in the most appropriate way. In this increasingly complex environment, successful organizations - public, private or governmental - need engineers with analytical and diverse skills, especially in integrating technical with commercial and organisational issues, analyses and ultimately solutions. It is the purpose and aim of the Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering stream to equip you with this knowledge and understanding to become a global engineer, indeed a leader, with the ability to apply analytical methods and quality processes to create short and long term value for your organization, your customers, and the community. It encapsulates the key elements of mechanical engineering and combines them with the five core disciplines of manufacturing and industrial engineering.<br />\n<br />\nAn engineer trained in Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering may be employed in a very flexible and diverse range of disciplines and areas of industrial activity, including; product design, process design, computer aided design, computer aided manufacturing, quality improvement, technical and commercial analysis and decision making, strategic decision making, consulting, sales support, technical and organisational maintenance, and supply chain management.",

Our Honours students are supervised in their Honours project by some of Australia&#39;s finest mathematicians.<br />\nStudents who enrol in the Applied Mathematics Honours Stream are expected to have completed a mathematics major in an undergraduate science or other mathematically focused program. Students who have completed degrees in other cognate disciplines and who are completing a project within the usual concerns of\u00a0applied mathematics may also apply for entry to this stream.<br />\nHonours in Applied Mathematics can be completed full-time or part-time.

The Honours year introduces students to the investigative and research aspects of knowledge and consists of advanced lecture courses, an Honours thesis and seminar participation. Our Honours students are supervised in their Honours project by some of Australia&#39;s finest mathematicians.</p>\n\n<p>Students who enrol in the Quantitative Data Science\u00a0Honours Stream are expected to have completed\u00a0the\u00a0 Quantitative Data Science major in the Bachelor of Data Science and Decisions (program 3959), or one of the other majors in that program including at least three level 3 MATH courses. Students who have completed degrees in other cognate disciplines and who are completing a project within the usual concerns of\u00a0data science\u00a0may also apply for entry to this stream.</p>\n\n<p>Honours in Quantitative Data Science can be completed full-time or part-time. Most students commence their enrolment in term 1\u00a0 but entry in term 3 is available subject to resources.\u00a0 Students should check the MathStats Honours webpages for application procedures and enrolment deadlines.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stream structure</strong></p>\n\n<p>The thesis component of Quantitative Data Science\u00a0honours requires a student to undertake an 18uoc thesis by enrolling in the course MATH4001 (Mathematics and Statistics Honours Thesis) in each of three successive terms. These courses form one thesis/project. Students (full or part-time)\u00a0can complete the honours thesis\u00a0 in any three consecutive terms of their honours enrolment.</p>\n\n<p>Students will also be required to participate in the weekly honours seminar, which will be timetabled as a joint class in the thesis courses. This seminar is intended to allow students to\u00a0practise their final honours seminar presentation, listen to presentations of other honours students and engage in other honours training activities. Students should also attend any appropriate seminars in their thesis area.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The thesis will be assessed by at least two academic staff. The supervisor or supervisors of the thesis is expected to submit a report, but will not be a marker for the thesis. Students are required to give a short seminar on their thesis and this will account for 10% of the final mark for the thesis, the remaining 90% coming from the written thesis report.</p>\n\n<p>The 30uoc coursework component of Quantitative\u00a0Data Science\u00a0Honours will consist of five 6uoc lecture courses selected from the list below, or others, including at least 18UoC of\u00a0MATH courses, taken with the approval by the Head of School or nominee and the advice of the honours thesis supervisor.</p>\n\n<ul></ul>\n",

Our Honours students are supervised in their Honours project by some of Australia&#39;s finest mathematicians.</p>\n\n<p>Students who enrol in the Physical Oceanography\u00a0Honours Stream are expected to have completed a mathematics major in an undergraduate science or other mathematically focused program. Students who have completed degrees in other cognate disciplines and who are completing a project within the usual concerns of\u00a0physical oceanography may also apply for entry to this stream.</p>\n\n<p>Honours in Physical Oceanography can be completed full-time or part-time. Most students commence their enrolment in term 1\u00a0 but entry in term 3 is available subject to resources. Students should check the MathStats Honours webpages for application procedures and enrolment deadlines.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Entry Requirements</strong></p>\n\n<p>So that students have sufficient background to attempt the courses in the honours year, students must discuss their selection of Level III courses with the Applied Mathematics Honours Coordinator or another academic adviser.</p>\n\n<p>To enter honours in applied mathematics, students must have</p>\n\n<ul><li>Completed a mathematics major in the Science or Advanced Science program or a physical oceanography major in the Science program, including at least 30 units of credit in Level III mathematics or which at least 18uoc must in in level III applied mathematics, <strong>or</strong></li><li>Completed Stage 3 of the applied mathematics plan in the Advanced Mathematics degree <strong>or</strong></li><li>Completed Stage 3 of the advanced physical oceanography major in Advanced Science or</li><li>Completed a suitable mathematics or statistics degree at another university.</li></ul>\n\n<p><em>In addition</em>, students will normally be required to have:</p>\n\n<ul><li>An average above 70 in their level III mathematics courses <strong>and</strong></li><li>An average above 70 in level III applied mathematics courses.</li></ul>\n\n<p>The level III applied mathematics courses at UNSW are those courses numbered from MATH3010 to MATH3399 inclusive.<br />\nWith the permission of the Head of School (or nominee), a student may be allowed into Physical Oceanography\u00a0Honours without having satisfied the specific departmental requirements, and instead have shown some evidence of the ability to undertake independent study.</p>\n",

These courses form one thesis/project. Students (full or part-time)\u00a0can complete the honours thesis\u00a0 in any three consecutive terms of their honours enrolment.</p>\n\n<p>Students will also be required to participate in the weekly honours seminar, which will be timetabled as a joint class in the thesis courses. This seminar is intended to allow students to\u00a0practise their final honours seminar presentation, listen to presentations of other honours students and engage in other honours training activities.\u00a0Students should also attend any appropriate seminars in their thesis area.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The thesis will be assessed by at least two academic staff. The supervisor or supervisors of the thesis is expected to submit a report, but will not be a marker for the thesis. Students are required to give a short seminar on their thesis and this will account for 10% of the final mark for the thesis, the remaining 90% coming from the written thesis report.</p>\n\n<p>The 30uoc coursework component of Physical Oceanography\u00a0honours will consist of five 6uoc lecture courses at honours/postgraduate level (typically MATH5xxx courses).\u00a0 The suite of courses must be approved by the Head of School or nominee and taken with the advice of the honours thesis supervisor. A student may be permitted to take one or, exceptionally, at most two, courses from outside the School of MathsStats, for example at the AMSI summer school, at another institution or at another UNSW academic unit.</p>\n\n<p>The marks for the thesis and other honours courses will be combined to give a weighted average mark forming a final honours mark which will be rounded up and used to decide the grade of honours the student will be awarded as follows:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Honours class 1 -- final mark of 85 or over</li><li>Honours class 2, Division 1 -- final mark from 75 to 84</li><li>Honours class 2, Division 2 -- final mark from 65 to 74</li><li>Honours class 3 -- final mark from 50 to 64</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students who successfully complete Mathematics or Statistics Honours are qualified to continue further in their research careers by applying to undertake postgraduate studies by PhD or Masters.

The Honours year introduces students to the investigative and research aspects of knowledge and consists of advanced lecture courses, an Honours thesis and seminar participation. We offer expert supervision across a wide range of areas in modern mathematics and statistics. Our Honours students are supervised in their Honours project by some of Australia&#39;s finest mathematicians.</p>\n\n<p>Students who enrol in the\u00a0Pure Mathematics Honours Stream are expected to have completed a mathematics major in an undergraduate science or other mathematically focused program. Students who have completed degrees in other cognate disciplines and who are completing a project within the usual concerns of pure mathematics may also apply for entry to this stream.</p>\n\n<p>Honours in\u00a0Pure Mathematics can be completed full-time or part-time. Most students commence their enrolment in term 1\u00a0 but entry in term 3 is available subject to resources. Students should check the MathStats Honours webpages for application procedures and enrolment deadlines.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Entry Requirements</strong></p>\n\n<p>So that students have sufficient background to attempt the courses in the honours year, students must discuss their selection of Level III courses with the\u00a0Pure Mathematics Honours Coordinator or another academic adviser.</p>\n\n<p>To enter honours in pure mathematics, students must have</p>\n\n<ul><li>Completed a mathematics major in the Science or Advanced Science program, including at least 30 units of credit in Level III mathematics of which at least 18uoc must be in level III pure mathematics, <strong>or</strong></li><li>Completed Stage 3 of the pure mathematics plans in the Advanced Mathematics degree <strong>or</strong>;</li><li>Completed a suitable mathematics or statistics degree at another university.</li></ul>\n\n<p><em>In addition</em>, students will normally be required to have:</p>\n\n<ul><li>An average above 70 in their level III mathematics courses <strong>and</strong></li><li>An average above 70 in level III pure mathematics courses.</li></ul>\n\n<p>The level III\u00a0pure mathematics courses\u00a0at UNSW\u00a0are those courses numbered from MATH3400 to MATH3799 inclusive.<br />\nWith the permission of the Head of School (or nominee), a student may be allowed into\u00a0Pure Mathematics Honours without having satisfied the specific departmental requirements, and instead have shown some evidence of the ability to undertake independent study.</p>\n",

These courses form one thesis/project. Students (full or part-time)\u00a0can complete the honours thesis\u00a0 in any three consecutive terms of their honours enrolment.</p>\n\n<p>Students will also be required to participate in the weekly honours seminar, which will be timetabled as a joint class in the thesis courses. This seminar is intended to allow students to\u00a0practise their final honours seminar presentation, listen to presentations of other honours students and engage in other honours training activities.\u00a0Students should also attend any appropriate seminars in their thesis area.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The thesis will be assessed by at least two academic staff. The supervisor or supervisors of the thesis is expected to submit a report, but will not be a marker for the thesis. Students are required to give a short seminar on their thesis and this will account for 10% of the final mark for the thesis, the remaining 90% coming from the written thesis report.</p>\n\n<p>The 30uoc coursework component of pure mathematics honours will consist of five 6uoc lecture courses at honours/postgraduate level (typically MATH5xxx courses), normally including both MATH5605 and\u00a0MATH5735.\u00a0 The full suite of courses must be approved by the Head of School or nominee and taken with the advice of the honours thesis supervisor. A student may be permitted to take one or, exceptionally, at most two, courses from outside the School of MathsStats, for example at the AMSI summer school, at another institution or at another UNSW academic unit.</p>\n\n<p>The marks for the thesis and other honours courses will be combined to give a weighted average mark forming a final honours mark which will be rounded up and used to decide the grade of honours the student will be awarded as follows:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Honours class 1 -- final mark of 85 or over</li><li>Honours class 2, Division 1 -- final mark from 75 to 84</li><li>Honours class 2, Division 2 -- final mark from 65 to 74</li><li>Honours class 3 -- final mark from 50 to 64</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students who successfully complete Mathematics or Statistics Honours are qualified to continue further in their research careers by applying to undertake postgraduate studies by PhD or Masters. Students with successful honours are qualified to enrol in a PhD program at UNSW. Students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.

The Honours year introduces students to the investigative and research aspects of knowledge and consists of advanced lecture courses, an Honours thesis and seminar participation. We offer expert supervision across a wide range of areas in modern mathematics and statistics. Our Honours students are supervised in their Honours project by some of Australia&#39;s finest mathematicians and statisticians.<br />\nStudents who enrol in the Statistics Honours Stream are expected to have completed a statistics or mathematics major in an undergraduate science or other mathematically focused program. Students who have completed degrees in other cognate disciplines and who are completing a project within the usual concerns of\u00a0statistics may also apply for entry to this stream.<br />\nHonours in Statistics\u00a0can be completed full-time or part-time. Most students commence their enrolment in term 1\u00a0 but entry in term 3 is available subject to resources. Students should check the MathStats Honours webpages for application procedures and enrolment deadlines.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Entry Requirements</strong></p>\n\n<p>So that students have sufficient background to attempt the courses in the honours year, students must discuss their selection of Level III courses with the\u00a0Statistics Honours Coordinator or another academic adviser.</p>\n\n<p>To enter honours in Statistics, students must have</p>\n\n<ul><li>Completed a Statistics major in the Science or Advanced Science program <strong>or</strong></li><li>Completed Stage 3 of the Advanced Statistics plans in the Advanced Mathematics degree <strong>or</strong>;</li><li>Completed a suitable mathematics or statistics degree at another university.</li></ul>\n\n<p><em>In addition</em>, students will normally be required to have:</p>\n\n<ul><li>An average above 70 in their level III mathematics courses <strong>and</strong></li><li>An average above 70 in level III statistics courses.</li></ul>\n\n<p>The level III statistics courses at UNSW are those courses numbered from MATH3800 to MATH3999 inclusive.</p>\n\n<p>With the permission of the Head of School (or nominee), a student may be allowed into Statistics\u00a0Honours without having satisfied the specific departmental requirements, and instead have shown some evidence of the ability to undertake independent study.</p>\n",

        "additional_info": "<p>The thesis component of statistics\u00a0honours requires a student to undertake an 18uoc thesis by enrolling in the course MATH4001 (Mathematics and Statistics Honours Thesis) in each of three successive terms. These courses form one thesis/project. Students (full or part-time)\u00a0can complete the honours thesis\u00a0 in any three consecutive terms of their honours enrolment.</p>\n\n<p>Students will also be required to participate in the weekly honours seminar, which will be timetabled as a joint class in the thesis courses. This seminar is intended to allow students to\u00a0practise their final honours seminar presentation, listen to presentations of other honours students and engage in other honours training activities.\u00a0Students should also attend any appropriate seminars in their thesis area.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The thesis will be assessed by at least two academic staff. The supervisor or supervisors of the thesis is expected to submit a report, but will not be a marker for the thesis. Students are required to give a short seminar on their thesis and this will account for 10% of the final mark for the thesis, the remaining 90% coming from the written thesis report.</p>\n\n<p>The 30uoc coursework component of statistics honours will consist of five 6uoc lecture courses at honours/postgraduate level (typically MATH5xxx courses).\u00a0 The suite of courses must be approved by the Head of School or nominee and taken with the advice of the honours thesis supervisor. A student may be permitted to take one or, exceptionally, at most two, courses from outside the School of MathsStats, for example at the AMSI summer school, at another institution or at another UNSW academic unit.</p>\n\n<p>The marks for the thesis and other honours courses will be combined to give a weighted average mark forming a final honours mark which will be rounded up and used to decide the grade of honours the student will be awarded as follows:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Honours class 1 -- final mark of 85 or over</li><li>Honours class 2, Division 1 -- final mark from 75 to 84</li><li>Honours class 2, Division 2 -- final mark from 65 to 74</li><li>Honours class 3 -- final mark from 50 to 64</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students who successfully complete Mathematics or Statistics Honours are qualified to continue further in their research careers by applying to undertake postgraduate studies by PhD or Masters. Students with successful honours are qualified to enrol in a PhD program at UNSW. Students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.

        "description": "<p>The discipline of mathematics at UNSW is divided into several areas of study: Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics and Statistics.</p>\n\n<p><em>Pure Mathematics</em> is the study of the essential structures of mathematics. Work by pure mathematicians underpins most of the technological advances of this century. Pure Mathematics is concerned with problems and techniques which transcend specific applications. Research, focusing on the development of existing theories or the creation of new ones, may be driven by applications or by the internal demands of the discipline. Pure Mathematics courses provide the insights and understanding required by those using mathematics, leading to mastery of the fundamental processes of mathematical science and the capacity for innovative applications in any area.</p>\n\n<p><em>Applied Mathematics</em> concerns the development of mathematics and models for understanding scientific phenomena, for the solution of technical and industrial problems, and for use in the social, economic and management sciences. Courses are designed to provide basic mathematical and computational skills needed for a wide range of applications, to develop the capability to construct, analyse and interpret mathematical models, and to encourage enthusiasm for the role of the mathematician in a variety of contexts.</p>\n\n<p><em>Statistics</em> is the science and art of using factual material for modelling and inference. Its mathematical foundations are in the theory of probability and it deals with how to estimate and make decisions using knowledge which is uncertain or observational material which is subject to error. There is a rich interplay of ideas between the theory of statistics and fields such as engineering, medicine and biological and behavioural sciences where statistical problems constantly arise.</p>\n\n<p>This stream is for a major in Mathematics for Education as part of a concurrent Bachelor of Science / Bachelor of Education program (4076). Only students enrolled concurrently in both a Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Education program may take this major. The major ensures that students meet all accreditation requirements with the NSW Institute of Teachers.</p>\n",

Students are expected to formulate their project rationale, objectives, literature survey, and project management plan, done formally in <a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/current/MATS4504.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">MATS4504 Research Training</a> (6UOC), then undertake and complete the work in a timely manner over one term. In most cases the project will involve substantial experimental work and this is usually done within established research groups in the School as well as in collaboration with other groups in the University and elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>The principal form of teaching is based on research supervision and direction by specialist researchers within the School of Materials Science and Engineering. Complementing this, students must complete <a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/current/MATS4503.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">MATS4503 Professional Skills</a> (6UOC) which includes formal training in professional communication, writing skills, project planning, data analysis, intellectual property, and risk management and workplace safety.</p>\n\n<p>Learning outcomes from this Honours stream will form the basis for future pursuits in materials science research but are also highly relevant for many other professions - both within the materials industry, but also in many other related yet diverse fields.</p>\n\n<p>The School offers a wide variety of student research projects in the Materials Science discipline including topics on synthesis and production of advanced materials, materials recycling, functional materials, sustainable materials, advanced surface coatings, electrical materials, biomedical materials, physical metallurgy, process metallurgy, etc. Most students would complete Honours as full-time students, where the program is completed over three consecutive terms. Part-time study is also possible depending on availability of supervision and suitable projects. Most students commence their enrolment in Term 1 (February) but Term 3 (September) entry\u00a0is available. Students should check the <a href=\"http://www.materials.unsw.edu.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">Materials Science website</a> for current enrolment deadlines, and assessment and completion dates.</p>\n",

These fascinating organisms impact on our lives in many ways. On the negative side, they cause disease in humans, animals and plants, and they spoil our food. However, microorganisms are also of great benefit. Indeed, microorganisms are the key participants for the turnover of nutrients and elements and they are the main producers of carbon and biomass. They turn the biological wheels on this globe and are responsible for sustainability of life. They also contribute to a better environment via recycling of organic wastes, maintenance of soil fertility and biodegradation of pollutants. Many foodstuffs, beverages, pharmaceuticals and other products of biotechnology are products of microbial action. The genetic engineering of microorganisms is a fundamental aspect of molecular biology and the way of the future.",

These fascinating organisms impact on our lives in many ways. On the negative side, they cause disease in humans, animals and plants, and they spoil our food. However, microorganisms are also of great benefit. Indeed, microorganisms are the key participants for the turnover of nutrients and elements and they are the main producers of carbon and biomass. They turn the biological wheels on this globe and are responsible for sustainability of life. They also contribute to a better environment via recycling of organic wastes, maintenance of soil fertility and biodegradation of pollutants. Many foodstuffs, beverages, pharmaceuticals and other products of biotechnology are products of microbial action. The genetic engineering of microorganisms is a fundamental aspect of molecular biology and the way of the future.",

Consideration of academic merit is focused on performance in third level Science subjects and overall WAM, and students must meet all requirements of their undergraduate degree (stages 1 to 3) before being considered eligible.</p>\n\n<p>Students with an average overall WAM of lower than 65/or an average of lower than 65 in third-level Science courses will usually not be accepted.</p>\n\n<p>Students who have achieved an average overall WAM of 65 or higher and an average of 65 or higher in third-level Science courses may be admitted if an approved supervisor is available.</p>\n\n<p>The major of a current BABS undergraduate student will normally determine their Honours category, but there is some flexibility depending on the student\u2019s interests and availability of supervisors. UNSW Medical Science students (3991 program) and graduates from other Australian or overseas universities are welcome to apply for the BABS Honours program. Their selected research project will determine the Honours area in which they enrol.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Admission Process</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students who meet the entry requirements, or expect to do so, should make contact with potential supervisors.

        "description": "Microbiology is the scientific study of the smallest forms of life namely, bacteria, viruses, archaea, fungi and protozoa. These fascinating organisms impact on our lives in many ways. On the negative side, they cause disease in humans, animals and plants, and they spoil our food. However, microorganisms are also of great benefit. Indeed, microorganisms are the key participants for the turnover of nutrients and elements and they are the main producers of organic carbon and biomass. They turn the biological wheels on this globe and are responsible for sustainability of life. They also contribute to a better environment via recycling of organic wastes, maintenance of soil fertility and biodegradation of pollutants. Many foodstuffs, beverages, pharmaceuticals and other products of biotechnology are products of microbial action. The genetic engineering of microorganisms is a fundamental aspect of molecular biology and the way of the future.<br />\n<br />\nA major in Medical Microbiology is only available to students enrolled in the Bachelor of Medical Science program.",

Year 1 of the stream includes courses that cover the sciences to provide the foundation for many of the engineering courses offered in Year 2. Year 3 is largely devoted to fundamental courses in mining engineering while Year 4 provides advanced instruction in aspects essential for all mining engineers. Elective courses are offered in both Year 3 and Year 4 of the stream.</p>\n\n<p>An important requirement in the fourth year is for students to undertake personal research or a study project in mining or minerals engineering for which they are required to submit a dissertation for examination. After graduation, mining engineers who choose to develop careers in operations management gain further practical experience to obtain a Mine Manager&#39;s Certificate of Competency, in either Coal or Metalliferous Mining. Formal arrangements are in place with the University of Newcastle for students who have completed a specified program to be admitted with advanced standing to Year 3 of the program at UNSW.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stream Structure</strong></p>\n\n<p>The stream structure shown indicates one sequence of courses that fulfils the requirements of the stream rules.</p>\n\n<p>As the stream structure indicates, a number of course electives are offered each term in Year 3 and Year 4.

        "description": "<p>The School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences (BEES) offers a number of Honours streams including Marine Science. Honours in Marine Science introduces undergraduate students to research and project work of relevance to various endeavours in the physical, environmental and ecological sciences with an emphasis on marine, aquatic and coastal environments. Students undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations. The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning this program is centred on Honours students taking on their \u2018role as a researcher\u2019 to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge with some degree of independence. The program, run over three terms, includes a Research Proposal (which includes an extended literature review and a risk management component) and a substantial and partly independent Research Project. These components are complemented by more formal seminars and workshops, focusing on graduate attributes (scientific communication, risk management, ethics and professional development) as well as School (and Institute/Centre) seminars.</p>",

Entry is also possible to students from other cognate disciplines or programs at the discretion of the Program Convener or the School of BEES Honours Coordinator. External students are welcome into all School of BEES Honours Programs but require approval of the Honours Coordinator and will require evidence of the completion of equivalent study.</p>\n<p>Students seeking to enrol in Honours are required to have completed a total of 144 units of credit and all the requirements for the Bachelor of Science (or equivalent). Admission into the BEES Honours Program is subject to academic performance and the number of places available in the School&#39;s Honours program. Typically students require a Credit average (\u226565% weight average mark; WAM) in their undergraduate degree for entry into Honours. Where students have an overall WAM that is less than, but close to a Credit, the School of BEES may take into consideration a student&#39;s academic performance in their Major area of study when assessing an application for Honours.</p>\n<p>Students must apply to the School of BEES for admission to enrol in the Honours Program: admission requirements and the number of places available are determined by the Head of School or nominee and are subject to the availability of resources. All decisions regarding admission to the School of BEES Honours program are final.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Admission Process</strong></p>\n<p>Potential students must first apply for acceptance into the School of BEES Honours Program and into the Marine Science stream and, following receipt of an offer of acceptance, students can proceed with enrolment. Application and Enrolment procedures are described on the <a href=\"http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">BEES Honours Program</a> webpage. It is highly recommended that students approach possible Honours Supervisors well before the deadlines to discuss potential Research Projects: supervisors and potential projects can also be found on the BEES Honours webpage. Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via <a href=\"http://research.unsw.edu.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">UNSW Research</a>. Students should then download and complete an application form and submit it to the BSB Student Office before the submission deadline. <strong>Please note:</strong> that this application must include an offer to supervise the Research Project as is detailed in the application form. Students accepted into the Program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the School of BEES Honours Program are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students who successfully complete the BEES Honours Program receive some Advanced Standing in <a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/programs/current/8623.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">8623 Masters of Environmental Management</a> and students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.</p>\n<p>Graduates of the BEES Honours Program are also well qualified to work in various endeavours. Past graduates have found employment in the private sector (e.g. resource and environmental management companies, environmental consultancies etc.) and in the public sector (local, state or federal government agencies and regulatory bodies). Potential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought after: in particular Honours students are equipped with advanced disciplinary knowledge, project design and management skills, consideration of Occupational Health and Safety issues and advanced (written and verbal) communication skills.</p>",

It requires studying higher-level coursework and completion of an independent research project, under the guidance of an academic supervisor. The Honours year commences in Term 1 and is undertaken full-time over 1 year. Term 3 entry may also be available. Part-time enrolment, commencing Term 1 only, may be available.</p>\n\n<p>Students complete 24 UOC of coursework by enrolling in PHYS4141 Quantum Mechanics (Honours) 6 UOC and PHYS4142 Statistical Physics (Honours) 6 UOC in Term 1, and PHYS4143 Topics in Contemporary Physics 12 UOC in Term 2. The Term 1 courses are assessed via assignments worth 40% and exams worth 60% of the final mark. In PHYS4143 students will take two of the four lecture modules offered in modern physics. These are assessed via a presentation (10%), assignments (30%) and final exam (60%). Coursework contributes 50% towards a student\u2019s final grade for honours.</p>\n\n<p>The other 50% of a Physics honours mark comes from completion of an original research project, conducted over three terms. Students complete 24 UOC of research by enrolling in PHYS4144 Physics Honours Research A 6 UOC in Term 1, PHYS4145 Physics Honours Research B 6 UOC in Term 2 and PHYS4146 Physics Honours Research C 12 UOC in Term 3. Projects are offered in all areas of research in the School: Astrophysics; Biophysics; Condensed Matter Physics; Music Acoustics and Theoretical Physics. Projects are also offered by academics in the Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology. A list of projects and supervisors will be available in the term before students begin honours.\u00a0Students are assessed by submission of a research proposal, literature review, and final thesis. The research proposal is worth 10%, the literature review contributes 20% and the thesis contributes 70% to the final research mark. These will be marked by two assessors within the School, one of whom will be the student&#39;s supervisor. Students are required to give a short talk about their research at the end of the year, but this is not assessable.</p>\n",

It aims to critically analyse the social relationships and institutions that shape our everyday lives, and to understand the role of power, inequality, and culture difference in these processes. In addition to providing an appreciation of this rich and diverse discipline, a major in sociology will equip you with the intellectual and practical tools to tackle contemporary social problems and inequalities such as those related to race, gender, sexuality, and class.\u00a0 It will also help you to analyse the complexities of rapid social change, technological disruption, and political polarisation to better understand how to make change in the world. Sociology graduates are therefore ideally positioned to make an impact in roles associated with policy making and government, social and community services, and research and academia. Most importantly, sociology will change the way you see the world and your place within it.</p>",

It aims to critically analyse the social relationships and institutions that shape our everyday lives, and to understand the role of power, inequality, and culture difference in these processes. If you are doing a major in the humanities, a minor in Sociology will give you an invaluable social and cross-cultural perspective. If you are majoring in a specialist social science, a minor in Sociology will give greater depth and cross-cultural breadth. If you are majoring in a discipline that is concerned with social and cultural trends, a minor in Sociology will improve your analytical skills, your conceptual understanding, and your appreciation of ethical relations. Most importantly, sociology will change the way you see the world and your place within it.</p>",

Emphasis is placed on gaining hands-on experience of working with solar energy devices, modules and systems.<br />\n<br />\nInnovative teaching techniques have been developed to enhance the learning environment including the &#39;Virtual Production Line&#39; and &#39;Virtual World Solar Car Challenge&#39;. UNSW academics in the photovoltaic field have been consistently ranked amongst the leaders worldwide through international peer review. This team has held the world record for silicon solar cell efficiencies for decades and were responsible for developing the most successfully commercialized new photovoltaic technology internationally throughout the same period. From 2006 onwards we have seen an explosion of interest in the School&#39;s technologies from major industry players all around the world.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Second Area of Specialisation</strong></p>\n\n<p>The cross-disciplinary nature of photovoltaics and renewable energy applications necessitates many PV engineers possessing broad engineering backgrounds or else working in teams with other engineers. A good example is the UNSW Solar Car Project involving PV engineers, electronics engineers, control engineers, mechanical engineers, chemical engineers, power engineers, biomedical engineers, computer engineers, and communication engineers. Therefore it is important for photovoltaic engineers to have a broader understanding of other engineering disciplines.</p>\n\n<p>A unique feature of this stream is that in Year 2, students have the opportunity to select a strand to complement their education in Photovoltaics and Solar Energy. Each strand comprises 18 units of credit with the opportunity to subsequently select additional electives in the corresponding area in the final two years, subject to the approval of the Undergraduate Coordinator. The strands available are listed below and cover areas such as computing, electronics, mathematics, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, physics, chemical engineering, and architecture. Students may also formulate their own strands subject to the approval of the Undergraduate Coordinator.</p>\n\n<p>Selection of a second area of specialisation is subject to the stream rule that states that no more than 60 UOC of first-year level courses may be counted toward the BE (Hons) in Photovoltaics and Solar Energy.</p>\n\n<p>Photovoltaics and Solar Energy is also available as a component of the dual degree programs.</p>\n",

Studying International Political Economy (IPE) enables you to come to grips with some of the most pressing questions in and of global politics today. You will enquire into the nature of both global and local relations of economic power, including how they are sustained by shifting patterns of knowledge and authority. You will examine the features and dynamics of forces such as capitalism, globalisation, neo- and postcolonialism, and will investigate the histories, knowledges and roles of particular actors, ideas, agendas and experiences. You will explore the fault lines created by global integration, economic crisis and deepening social, political and economic inequality. As you develop your ideas and build a personal, and always political, sense of how politics shapes economics, and vice versa, you will participate directly in the evolving relationship between theory, practice and policymaking.</p>",

You will not only develop your knowledge of the Spanish language, but also gain intercultural awareness and understanding of the Spanish-speaking world. You will study cultures, communities, societies, history, film and literature in the Spanish-speaking world. The Spanish language plays a key role in expressing the cultures and identities of the places in which it is spoken. Spanish Studies will provide you with a privileged form of access to the cultural resources and complex patterns of life in other countries. Developing competence in Spanish will have an important place in promoting relationships and mutual understanding between countries and peoples.</p>\n<p>There are two main components of the Spanish Studies major. The first is a focus on the acquisition of competence in the Spanish language. Acquiring target language competence involves a wide range of knowledge and understanding as well as skills in self-expression, both oral and written, and skills in comprehending other people&#39;s expression, both oral and written. The second component is the study of aspects of the cultures and societies associated with the Spanish language. We draw upon other disciplines in order to inform understanding of Spanish cultures. These disciplines include linguistic, literary, cultural, historical, developmental and social productions.</p>\n<p>This specialisation is available to students commencing at Introductory and Intermediate entry levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Placement Information</strong></p>\n<p>If you have prior language knowledge you will need to take an online placement evaluation so that we can assess your skills and select an appropriate level of course for you.

Students undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations. The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning this course is centred on Honours students taking on their \u2018role as a researcher\u2019 to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge. <br />\n<br />\nStudent research projects relate to multiple fields of physics and closely related research interests of staff.<br />\n<br />\nThe Physics Honours stream involves undertaking a research project that, although conducted under supervision, contains substantial independent research and self-direction. The research project is described in a thesis that forms a major part of the assessment. The research project is complemented by introductory written and oral background presentations and oral presentation of the research project. There are also relevant advanced level courses that students must undertake.",
